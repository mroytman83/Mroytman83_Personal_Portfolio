Introduction\nIn sports nutrition, management of the body composition of athletes is a common\npractice.  Loss of body weight (BW) in athletes is generally motivated by the desire to\noptimize performance by increasing the strength-to-body weight ratio (e.g., powerlifting\nor weightlifting) or to compete in a discipline limited by BW category (e.g., boxing), or for\naesthetic reasons in sports that require it (e.g., bodybuilding) [1–4]. However, a hypocaloric\ndiet could result in a significant loss of fat-free mass (FFM), which could affect the athlete’s\nperformance [1,5,6]. Therefore, nutritional strategies during a weight loss phase in athletes,\nin addition to reducing fat mass (FM), should aim to maintain FFM [5,7,8].\nCurrent recommendations regarding BW loss in athletes favor more moderate ap-\nproaches with the intention of minimizing the negative effects associated with rapid BW\nloss.  It has been observed that a loss of BW of 0.5–1.0 %/week, accompanied by a high\nprotein intake and resistance exercises, could favor the retention of FFM during fat loss\nphases [1,3–5,7–14]. Nevertheless, the scientific literature on this topic in resistance-trained\nNutrients2021,13, 3255. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13093255https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/fat_loss.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Achieving an Optimal Fat Loss Phase in Resistance-Trained Athletes: A Narrative Review","Author":"Carlos Ruiz-Castellano, Sergio Espinar, Carlos Contreras, Fernando Mata, Alan A.

The latest research focuses on bodybuilders, being necessary\nscientific literature on dietary–nutritional and supplementation recommendations for fat\nloss in these athletes [4,15,16].\nUnlike in other sports where strength exercise is used to complement to the athlete’s\nspecific training, in disciplines such as powerlifting, weightlifting and bodybuilding, resis-\ntance training forms the basis of the training [17]. While in weightlifting and powerlifting,\na reduction in FM could improve performance through an increase in the strength-to-body\nweight ratio [8,17,18], in preparation for a bodybuilding competition, a drastic reduction in\nFM is required to achieve optimal muscle definition [4,19–22].\nThe aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of dietary–nutritional\nstrategies for the loss of FM and the maintenance of FFM in resistance-trained athletes from\na theoretical and contextual point of view, to enable focused future systematic reviews\nin some subtopics.  This review can be an evidence-based guide for implementing the\nlimited and relevant available data to resistance-trained athletes during periods of calorie\nrestriction.\n2. Materials and Methods\nThe work comprised a descriptive study, involving a narrative review, to answer the\nresearch question, “What are the dietary–nutritional recommendations for optimal fat loss\nin resistance-trained athletes?”. A structured search was carried out in the PubMed,Epites-\nmonikos and Scopus databases, using descriptors as the Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH),\nentry terms and natural vocabulary related to the aim of the study(Appendix A).In addition,\nreference lists were used for further search of the selected papers for related references.\n3. Energy Intake\nTo achieve weight loss, the implementation of an energy deficit is required, by re-\nduction of the energy intake (EI) and/or an increase in caloric expenditure. The exercise\nactivity thermogenesis (EAT) is one of the components of energy expenditure associated\nwith physical activity-related energy expenditure [23,24].  The magnitude and duration\nof this energy deficit will determine the amount of weight loss [25]. The performance of\nresistance exercise prevents the loss of FFM during periods of caloric restriction (CR) [8];\nhowever, resistance-trained athletes represent a population that already performs this\ntype of training. Traditionally, the 3500 kcal [26,27] rule has been used, which postulates\nthat after accumulating a weekly caloric deficit of 3500 kcal, 1 lb of BW (0.45 kg) is lost.\nHowever, this static mathematical model of weight loss has been repeatedly questioned\nsince, among other issues, it does not necessarily account for the metabolic adaptations\ncaused by the energy deficit itself [23,28,29],  nor the non-lipid fraction of the adipose\ntissue [30,31].  Hall et al. [32] recently proposed the “rule of 55 kcal/day per pound of\nBW”.  Hall et al. [30] explain that a person who maintains a deficit of 500 kcal per day\ncould reduce their weight by 9 lb (4 kg) in total over a year (500 kcal/day divided by\n55 kcal/day/lb), reaching a plateau at 12 months. With this 55 kcal/day rule, Hall et al.\nindicate a dynamic relationship between diet calories and weight loss and presents a more\nrealistic view of the challenges experienced by patients with obesity [30]. However, after\nan objective analysis, it can be seen that the caloric intake of these people increased in an\nunconscious manner over time [33], due in part to the increased appetite experienced after\nthe application of an energy deficit [34]. This fact, added to the physiological adaptations\nthat reduce daily energy expenditure [35], facilitates the appearance of the so-called plateau\nin weight loss. Some of these adaptations are highlighted in the review of Trexler et al. [36],\nwho concluded that after the implementation of a caloric deficit in order to lose fat, the body\nactivates different mechanisms to minimize this weight loss. These include a reduction in\ndaily energy expenditure (mainly due to the loss of body mass itself and the decrease in\nenergy expenditure associated with physical activities other than exercise, the so-called\nnon-exercise activity thermogenesis or NEAT), greater mitochondrial efficiency in the use\nof energy and changes in circulating hormone levels. Therefore, these factors should be","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/fat_loss.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Achieving an Optimal Fat Loss Phase in Resistance-Trained Athletes: A Narrative Review","Author":"Carlos Ruiz-Castellano, Sergio Espinar, Carlos Contreras, Fernando Mata, Alan A.

In aesthetic athletes, these adaptations are reduced, in\npart because these athletes are characterized by strict adherence to their diets [37], and by\nincreased daily energy expenditure through cardiovascular exercise throughout contest\npreparation [38–44].\nAn important aspect to consider when determining the magnitude of the caloric deficit\nis the potential for more aggressive energy restriction to result in greater loss of FFM [1], as\nindicated by the results of several case studies which showed greater retention of FFM with\nweekly weight losses of 0.5% [45] than with losses of 0.7% [38] or 1% of BW per week [39].\nIn the case of the latter study, the loss of FFM amounted to 42.8% of the total weight. These\ndata are in line with the last two revisions of the nutritional recommendations for athletes\nduring their preparation for a natural bodybuilding competition [4,15], for which slow\nweight losses were recommended in order to preserve the maximum amount of FFM,\nespecially in the final stage of preparation, since, as the competitor reduces his or her FM,\nthe risk of FFM loss increases when he or she is subjected to a caloric deficit [8].\n3.1. Low Energy Availability\nEnergy availability (EA) is a scientific concept that describes how much energy is\navailable for the basic metabolic functions of the body when EAT is subtracted from\nEI [22]. To calculate EA, EAT is subtracted from EI and the result is divided by the FFM\n[(EI-EAT)/FFM].\nLow energy availability (LEA) consists of a mismatch between EI and EAT, resulting in\nan amount of energy that is inadequate to support the body’s requirements for maintenance\nof optimal health and performance.  In women, EA for optimal physiological function\namounts to 45 kcal/kg FFM/day [46]. Below a threshold of 30 kcal/kg FFM/day, hormonal\nalterations can appear (disruption in female sex hormones, decreases in T3, insulin, GH,\nIGF-1, leptin, and glucose, and increased cortisol). However, it has been observed that not\nall women respond in the same way to the same energy insufficiency [22,46,47]. Recently,\nAlwan et al. [20] reviewed the physiological and psychological implications of preparations\nfor aesthetic competitions in female athletes,  concluding that in these disciplines it is\ncommon for female athletes to remain below this threshold for prolonged periods of\ntime, especially in the pre-competitive phase, in which energy availability ranged between\n18.2 and 31.1 kcal/kgFFM/day [40,44]. Due to this, hormonal alterations and irregularities\nin menstruation [20] are quite frequent, and in some cases up to 71 weeks post-competition\ncan be necessary to restore the menstrual cycle [40].   The appearance of irregularities\nin the menstrual cycle is frequently used as a secondary indicator of a long-term LEA;\nhowever, the use of contraceptive hormones could prevent this relationship from being\nestablished in some cases [20,48]. Considering the high prevalence of the use of hormonal\ncontraceptives [20,49], it is possible that many female athletes who experience LEA are not\ndetected, since the use of these contraceptives could maintain regular menstruation [20].\nFagerberg [22] reviewed the consequences of LEA in natural bodybuilders, concluding\nthat, in men, an EA <25 kcal/kg FFM/day results in a greater loss of FFM, hormonal\nalterations, psychological problems, and, in cases where FM percentages close to 4–5%\nare reached, possible problems in the cardiovascular system [22]. It seems that the male\nreproductive  system  and  the  related  hormones  have  lower  energy  requirements  and,\nconsequently, are affected to a lesser degree by LEA compared to the reproductive system\nin women [22,50,51].\n3.2. Diet Break\nA strategy proposed for the prevention of these adaptations is the implementation\nof a phase of time (1–2 weeks) in which caloric intake is increased to maintenance levels.\nByrne et al. [52], in the so-called “MATADOR study”, implemented this intermittent caloric\nrestriction strategy.  The control group (CON) performed 16 consecutive weeks of CR\nwhile the intervention group (INT) performed blocks of 2 weeks of CR intercalated with","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/fat_loss.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Achieving an Optimal Fat Loss Phase in Resistance-Trained Athletes: A Narrative Review","Author":"Carlos Ruiz-Castellano, Sergio Espinar, Carlos Contreras, Fernando Mata, Alan A.

During the maintenance periods, this weight was not recovered, and in terms of the\nreduction in resting metabolic rate (RMR), there were no differences between the groups.\nHowever, when the results were adjusted for body composition (FM and FFM), the RMR\nreduction in the INT group was significantly lower (−86 vs.−179 kcal/day in the INT\nand CON groups, respectively). Nonetheless, this lesser reduction in the RMR group is not\nenough to explain the greater loss of fat experienced, and it is possible that in this group\nthere was greater adherence to the diet prescribed by the researchers [52].\nThese  results  must  be  interpreted  with  caution  as  they  derive  from  a  sample  of\nindividuals with obesity who were physically inactive and did not perform resistance\nexercise; however, they can be used to generate hypotheses and new interventions. More\nrecently, Peos et al. [53], comprising an intervention in strength athletes, the control group\nperformed a linear CR for 12 weeks with 3 weeks of subsequent maintenance, whereas the\nintervention group performed 4 blocks of 3 weeks of CR with a maintenance week between\neach one. In addition to changes in body composition, the authors analyzed performance,\nphysical activity, sleep and hormones involved in regulating hunger, among other variables.\nPeos et al. [53] concluded that similar fat loss and fat-free mass retention are achieved\nwith linear CR and intermittent CR. For more information on this type of protocol, the\nrecent review by Peos et al. [54] is recommended. Currently, the minimum number of days\nnecessary to reverse the adaptations caused by CR itself and the frequency with which it\nwould be necessary to increase energy intake until maintenance level are unknown. So, a\n“diet break” of two weeks could be excessively long, thus increasing the time necessary to\nachieve the desired fat loss, time that could be used to gain muscle mass [16].\n4. Macronutrients\n4.1. Protein\nOne of the main goals during a fat loss phase in strength athletes, in addition to\nreducing FM, is to preserve FFM. During sustained periods of energy deficit, the rate of\nmuscle protein synthesis (MPS) is reduced in periods of fasting, after food intake and in\nthe post-training period [55–57]. In addition, as muscle is a reservoir of amino acids, it can\nbe catabolized during a period of negative energy balance in order to provide precursors\nfor gluconeogenesis and oxidative energy metabolism [58,59], resulting in a negative net\nprotein balance and a possible loss of musculoskeletal mass [55].\nMorton et al. [60], in their recent systematic review, concluded that the protein require-\nments of athletes who perform resistance training are around 1.6 g/kg BW/day under\nenergy sufficiency—that is, when there is a balance between the energy consumed and\nthe energy required.  However, the preparation phase prior to a competition is charac-\nterized by a period in which a sustained energy deficit is established and prevails over\ntime, and several authors have suggested the need to increase protein intake during this\nstage [8,12,59,61,62]. Therefore, the optimal protein intake for resistance-trained athletes\nduring an FM loss phase could be higher than the existing recommendations for optimiza-\ntion of muscle mass gains with adequate energy availability [60], as suggested in a recent\nopinion article [62].\nHelms et al. [12], in the only systematic review of results obtained for athletes who per-\nform resistance training during periods of CR, suggested a protein intake of2.3–3.1 g/kg\nFFM/day. However, the conclusions of these authors should be viewed with caution due\nto the heterogeneity of the designs and samples of the studies reviewed [63]. Hector and\nPhillips [8], in a recent review of the protein recommendations for weight loss in elite\nathletes, suggested an intake of 1.6–2.4 g/kg BW/day, opting for the higher values in\nthis range when the caloric deficit used is higher and the athlete’s body fat percentage\nis lower.  This last aspect deserves special attention in the case of bodybuilders during\ncompetitive phases, since they reach extremely low values of body fat [37], a condition that","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/fat_loss.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Achieving an Optimal Fat Loss Phase in Resistance-Trained Athletes: A Narrative Review","Author":"Carlos Ruiz-Castellano, Sergio Espinar, Carlos Contreras, Fernando Mata, Alan A.

The Interna-\ntional Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN), in its latest position on protein and exercise [61],\nsuggests that trained strength athletes could benefit from diets high in protein; however,\nbetter results were not obtained with intakes greater than 2.6 g protein/kg BW/day. Re-\ncently,Bandegan et al.analyzed the protein requirements of bodybuilders on non-training\ndays, using the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique, and estimated needs of\n2.2 g/kg BW/day[66]. It should be noted that these results were obtained 48 h after the\nlast training session in young athletes (on average, 22.5 years old) who were following\na diet adjusted to their caloric requirements.  Therefore, these data must be interpreted\nwith caution since we do not know if they are representative or can be extrapolated to\ntraining days, CR phases and/or older athletes [8,60,67,68]. An additional caveat is that\nthe IAAO technique assesses protein synthesis at the whole-body level [69], which limits\nthis method’s ability to draw firm conclusions about skeletal muscle anabolism specifically.\nAnother reason high-protein diets are proposed for a fat loss phase is their effect on\nsatiety [70,71].  Dhillon et al.  published a recent meta-analysis in which they concluded\nthat high-protein meals increased the feeling of fullness to a greater degree than meals\nlower in protein [72].   However,  this review focused on the short-term impact (up to\n10 h) in untrained subjects and the results analyzed may not be extrapolatable to long-\nterm satiety.  In addition, it has not been determined whether, in a population that has\npreviously consumed a diet high in protein, as is the case of bodybuilders or strength\nathletes [37], increasing the amount of protein consumed generates greater satiety.  In\nrelation to this issue, Roberts et al.  performed a randomized, controlled trial in which\nstrength-trained athletes underwent a short period of energy deficit [2]. The 16 participants\nwere randomized into two groups, moderate protein intake (1.8 g/kg/ BWday) and high\nprotein intake (2.9 g/kg/ BWday) for 7 days, matching the caloric deficit of both through\na crossover design. The researchers concluded that there do not seem to be any benefits\nregarding perceived satiety when consuming high-protein diets, relative to diets with\na moderate protein content [2].  Caution should be applied to this conclusion since the\nphysical properties of food are known to affect satiety, and a liquid form (whey) was used\nto supplement protein intake in the high-protein condition. Since solid and more viscous\nfoods tend to provide greater satiation and appetite suppression than liquid forms [73],\nquestions remain about how results may have differed if solid protein sources were used.\n4.2. Carbohydrates\nIn sports nutrition, in terms of performance, the importance of carbohydrates (CHO),\nbefore,  during  and  after  intense  and  high-volume  exercises,  has  been  repeatedly  re-\nviewed [74–76], highlighting the dependence that exists in relation to their consumption in\nadequate amounts by athletes with competitive objectives, both in endurance disciplines\nand in team sports [77]. However, the role of CHO, and its manipulation in strength and\naesthetic sports, has not been studied as widely [78–80].\nUnlike endurance sports, in which a single multi-hour training session could com-\npletely deplete the glycogen stores [81], a strength training session can result in a 24–40%\nreduction in muscle glycogen stores [82–85], depending on the volume and intensity of the\nsession, the musculature recruited and the rest between series [17]. The depletion is greater\nin those sessions in which exercises are performed with a high number of repetitions and\nmoderate load [83].  This difference in the use of energy resources is important in order\nto set the CHO requirements for strength exercises; above all, to establish the minimum\nrequirements below which performance could be compromised. On this issue, Slater and\nPhillips published a review of the nutritional requirements in strength sports, in which\nthey concluded that a CHO intake of 4–7 g/kg BW/day would be adequate in strength\nathletes, according to their training phase [17]. Nonetheless, these conclusions should be\ntaken with caution since they were elaborated solely on the basis of two aspects: (1) the\nCHO recommendation obtained as an average of the data extracted from multiple observa-\ntional studies based on dietary surveys, which provided a consumption of 3–5 g CHO/kg","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/fat_loss.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Achieving an Optimal Fat Loss Phase in Resistance-Trained Athletes: A Narrative Review","Author":"Carlos Ruiz-Castellano, Sergio Espinar, Carlos Contreras, Fernando Mata, Alan A.

The results obtained through these\nmethodologies may not be representative of the real CHO requirements of resistance-\ntrained athletes.  However, in a recent review on CHO in strength and aesthetic sports\npublished by Cholewa et al. [84], these CHO levels of 4–7 g CHO/kg BW recommended by\nSlater and Phillips [17] continue to be recommended for resistance-trained athletes. Despite\nthe appearance of a consensus agreement on 4–7 g/kg BW, three recent reviews of CHO\nrequirements in strength sports question this figure and show that CHO intakes of 1–3 g/kg\nBW may not reduce performance or interfere with post-exercise cell signaling [78–80]. On\nthe other hand, Chappell et al. [21] observed that natural bodybuilders who placed in the\ntop five in competitions had higher CHO consumption before and during the preparation\nfor competition than those who placed out of the top five. From this, the authors concluded\nthat the higher intake of CHO could have contributed to the maintenance of FFM during\npreparation. However, the mean number of years of training of those classified in the top\nfive was 3.3 years higher than for the unclassified athletes (14.2 and 10.9 years, respectively),\nand the energy intake at the beginning, in the intermediate phase and at the end of the\ncompetition was≈400 kcal/day higher in the classified group, so these results should be\ninterpreted with caution.\nThe CHO consumption during the FM loss phase in resistance-trained athletes could\nbe established in a wide range (2–5 g/kg BW), adjusting the intake to the individual\ncaloric requirements of the athlete and their food preferences, in order to increase the\nadherence to the diet.  This wide range is mainly due to the low reduction in muscle\nglycogen during a strength session [82–85], which reduces the requirements compared\nto other disciplines [77].  However, although low-CHO diets can be effective, there is a\nmuscle glycogen threshold below which performance during training may be affected\nif muscle contraction is compromised.  When muscle glycogen falls below 70 mmol/kg\ndry weight, the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is impaired, as is the\nmaximum power [81], which indicates that there is a threshold for muscle glycogen below\nwhich muscle function and performance could be affected [81]. Therefore, the minimum\nCHO intake should ensure a replenishment of muscle glycogen so that it at least exceeds\nthis lower limit (70 mmol/kg) during training, this amount (expressed in g/kg BW/day)\nbeing variable based on the athlete’s own characteristics, as well as the rest of the activities\ncarried out in addition to training (e.g., physically demanding jobs).\nWith that said, it should be noted that the goal of increasing or preserving maximal\nstrength may allow greater flexibility with lower intakes of CHO. The majority of investi-\ngations of the effect of ketogenic diets on resistance training performance have not shown\ndecrements compared to control/non-ketogenic conditions [91]. This preservation of per-\nformance (lifting strength) following ketogenic diets has been demonstrated in resistance-\ntrained subjects at moderate [92] and near-maximal to maximal loading [18,93,94]. There-\nfore, while ketogenic diets (<10% of total energy by CHO, or≤50 g CHO/day) might be\nsub-optimal for maximizing FFM preservation [18,93], they do not appear to have the same\npotential for compromising strength preservation.\nTo avoid the ergolytic potential of low glycogen storage, in addition to opting for a\ndiet with a higher daily CHO content, the strategy known as “Refeed” or “carbohydrate\nloading” can also be used.  This consists of increasing dietary CHO and calories to lev-\nels equal to or higher than maintenance in a timely and scheduled manner within the\nplanning [36].  Generally, in bodybuilding, the protocols used last 24 h, once or twice a\nweek [95], although the trials that have studied refeed protocols used them for at least three\ndays per week[96,97].The supposed objective of this strategy is to temporarily increase","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/fat_loss.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Achieving an Optimal Fat Loss Phase in Resistance-Trained Athletes: A Narrative Review","Author":"Carlos Ruiz-Castellano, Sergio Espinar, Carlos Contreras, Fernando Mata, Alan A.

There is evidence that\nleptin is sensitive to brief periods of refeeding with CHO, but not with fats (FAT) [96].\nDirlewanger et al.  observed that, after three days of refeeding with CHO, leptin had\nincreased by 28% and daily energy expenditure by 7%. However, this protocol consisted\nof a caloric overingestion of 40% above maintenance for three days to achieve only a 7%\nincrease in energy expenditure [96], which returns to baseline values once the caloric deficit\nis restored [98,99]. This increase in RMR has been verified in athletes in post-competitive\nperiods. For example, Trexler et al. observed how energy expenditure was higher in the\nweeks after a competition than in the days before; in these weeks, the intake of calories,\nCHO and fat was higher [100]. This proposed increase in energy intake to maintenance\nlevels by increasing CHO should be offset by a reduction in energy intake on the other\ndays of the week in order to maintain the programmed caloric deficit.\nTo conclude the CHO section, the recommendations established by European Food\nSafety Authority (EFSA) for fiber consumption are 25 g/day [101], an amount applicable to\nthe sports population. An increase in fiber could be useful in the search for greater satiety\nduring the CR phase [102], although its excessive consumption could be detrimental to the\nabsorption of some nutrients [103].\n4.3. Fats\nIn sports nutrition, the intake of FAT should, as in the general population, facilitate\nadequate consumption of essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins, replenish intra-\nmuscular triglyceride stores, and maintain the energy balance [77,104]. The manipulation\nof this macronutrient, regarding the amount and source of dietary FAT, could have an\nimpact on health and on the concentration in the blood of some anabolic hormones, which\ncould also affect body composition and performance [4,77,104–107]. However, this effect\non anabolic hormones could be due to the limited calorie intake—so, to draw conclusions,\nmore studies are needed on this topic.\nAesthetic athletes, for example, are required to undergo CR periods in their respective\npre-competitive phases to achieve the desired physique.  Some authors have observed\nthat diets with a low fat intake (≤20% FAT) can reduce testosterone levels [106,108]. Nev-\nertheless, it is difficult to extract a direct association of these two variables due to other\ncharacteristics of the trials; in addition to a low fat intake, the subjects undergoing CR\nhad a low percentage of body fat and a low intake of saturated fat and polyunsaturated\nfatty acids [4,107,109–111].  If, to establish the energy deficit, it is decided to reduce the\ncontribution of FAT, the recommendation is to ensure an intake of 20–30% of the total daily\nenergy supply or, if that is not possible due to the caloric limitation and to prioritization of\nan adequate intake of PRO and CHO, a daily FAT intake of at least 0.5 g/kg BW should be\nensured [77]. Regarding the reduction in testosterone levels with low fat intakes, increasing\nthe intake of saturated fat could improve the situation [4,112], as could opting for less\naggressive weekly weight losses (0.5% BW/week) [113].\nIn terms of maintenance of FFM, low-calorie diets high in PRO, high in CHO, and\nlow in FAT [1,114] yielded better results than those interventions that opted for high PRO\nand FAT, but a low contribution of CHO [55,115]; to the latter studies we can add the data\nobtained recently by Chappell and collaborators, mentioned previously [21].\nIn aesthetic sports, due to the characteristics of these disciplines, sometimes it will not\nbe possible to consume the recommended intake of FAT [77]—for instance, when energy\nrequirements are limited and an adequate consumption of PRO and CHO is prioritized.\n5.

One of the representative examples of this erroneous extrapola-\ntion of the results is the recommendation of a rapid intake of CHO at the end of the training\nsession in order to rapidly replenish muscle glycogen. In endurance sports, where high\nvolumes of training sessions can significantly reduce or even completely deplete glycogen\nstores [81], it is justifiable to take advantage of the greater glycogen resynthesis capacity\nthat occurs in the hours after training [116].  However, the need for this rapid glycogen\nreplacement has not been demonstrated in resistance trained athletes, who perform only\none training session per day. If extra sessions of cardiovascular exercise are added in order\nto increase the total daily energy expenditure (for example, for bodybuilders during contest\npreparation), it might be advisable to include CHO intake at the end of the first training\nsession, to replenish glycogen stores and prepare for the second session of the day.\nTrials examining the timing of CHO intake in strength sports are scarce [116]. Those\nstudies in which pre-strength training CHO were administered to subjects with moderate\nglycogen depletion found no improvement in performance [116].  To date, there is only\none report of positive results in terms of performance when administering CHO before\nand during different series of resistance exercises [117]. However, ergogenic effects were\nonly observed in the second resistance training sessions carried out on the same day [117];\ntherefore, prioritizing the fulfillment of total daily CHO requirements seems to be more\nimportant than the temporal aspects of consumption relative to the training sessions.\nRegarding the protein intake by participants in aesthetic and strength sports, several\nimportant aspects should be taken into account. One of them is the time of intake (pre- vs\npost-training). Several reviews have observed that when the total daily protein amount\nis the same for both groups, no differences are obtained between pre- and post-training\nintake [118,119].  Another issue regarding protein timing is the intake of protein before\nsleep. Recently, Snijders et al. [120] extensively reviewed the impact of protein intake prior\nto sleep on the adaptive response to exercise of skeletal muscle, reaching the conclusion\nthat this intake is an effective strategy to increase the rate of MPS during nighttime sleep\nand can be applied as a tool to benefit the adaptive response of skeletal muscle to resistance\nexercise [120]. Despite the conclusions reached by these authors, analysis of the studies\nthat make up this review highlights an important confounding variable that does not\nappear in the conclusions, but does appear in the discussion.  In those studies in which\ngreater gains in hypertrophy and/or strength were achieved, as in the case of the results\nobtained by Snijders et al. [121], by providing a placebo to the non-supplemented group,\nthe daily protein intake of the group with pre-sleep protein was superior to that of the\ncontrol group: 1.9 vs 1.3 g/kg BW respectively. Therefore, the greater gains in strength and\nhypertrophy cannot be attributed solely to protein intake prior to sleep, since it has not\nbeen compared with a protein intake of the same magnitude at any other time of the day. It\nis more likely that the greater gains occurred because the supplemented group consumed\nan amount of protein close to that recommended to optimize muscle mass gains [60]. In\nfact, when the amount of protein is equalized, enabling a comparison of the same amount\nof protein administered at night or at another time of the day, the results are similar for\nboth groups [122,123]. Therefore, based on the current evidence, pre-sleep protein intake\ncould be recommended in those situations in which the recommended daily amount of\nprotein is not reached, while remaining aware that the intake of this protein could occur at\nany other time of the day, as it would produce similar results.\nProbably, the most important factor in protein timing is how the intake is distributed\nthroughout the day. Regarding the amount of protein ingested per meal, there seems to\nbe a minimum protein threshold (mainly dependent on the leucine content) required to\nstimulate MPS [124,125]: 0.40–0.55 g/kg BW, increasing to 0.60 g/kg BW in the elderly [126],\nthis being the amount of protein per intake which maximizes the MPS response, since it\nensures that in each of these intakes the leucine content is≥1–3 g [61].\nHowever, in recent years, the hypothesis of the “muscle full effect” has emerged,\nwhich states that the high presence of amino acids in plasma stimulates MPS for a short\nperiod of time, after which a refractory period appears in which the muscle seems not to","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/fat_loss.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Achieving an Optimal Fat Loss Phase in Resistance-Trained Athletes: A Narrative Review","Author":"Carlos Ruiz-Castellano, Sergio Espinar, Carlos Contreras, Fernando Mata, Alan A.

After protein intake, anddepending on\nthe kinetics of the protein ingested, there is a period of 45–90 min before the MPS rises; it\nreaches a maximum at 90–120 min, before returning to baseline values even though the\namino acid levels remain high [127]. This suggests that a 2–3 h period should be allowed\nbetween protein intakes to enable MPS re-stimulation. This theory requires more research\nsince, at the moment, the mechanisms of action are not known [124], and there are results\nthat contradict it, such as those of Churchward-Venne et al. [129]. These authors observed\nthat, in the group that ingested 25 g of whey protein after training, the response of MPS was\ngreater at 3–5 h than at 1–3 h post-ingestion, a situation that was not replicated in the group\nthat did not perform strength training but did ingest the same amount of protein (128).\nThis indicates that, at least post-exercise, the “muscle full effect” theory has limitations.\nRegarding the co-ingestion of CHO and PRO, it has been established that when both\nare ingested in adequate amounts, their combination does not result in any improvement\nin performance or in short and/or long-term adaptations [116] to resistance training.\n6. Frequency\nIn strength sports, traditional dietary protocols have featured a high number of daily\nintakes [37,95]. The reasoning is usually that they: (1) increase metabolism and (2) maintain\na constant supply of amino acids.  The second point has already been discussed in the\nprevious section, where it was mentioned that continued high levels of amino acids in the\nblood do not necessarily induce a greater or more extensive response of MPS [127,128].\nRegarding the increase in metabolism, two studies involving metabolic chambers showed\nthat no significant differences in thermogenesis were induced by changes in the frequency\nof ingestion, using a wide range (two to seven) of daily meals [130,131].\nCurrently, there is a trend towards a lower number of meals per day (for example,\n1–2) restricted to a short period of time during the day.  Recently, Peos et al.  reviewed\nthe available literature on intermittent caloric restriction, concluding that, in those studies\nin which energy and nutrient intake are equal, and the only difference is the number of\nmeals per day or the time window of feeding, there are no differences in terms of body\ncomposition [54].  Trials regarding intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding (TRF;\ntypically involving an 8-h feeding window) and maintenance of FFM during periods of\ncaloric deficit show mixed results, finding studies in which there is no difference in loss of\nFFM [132–134] and other trials in which there is less preservation of FFM in the group that\nperformed intermittent fasting [135].\nTherefore, once the most relevant aspects of protein timing and the frequency of\ndaily meals have been considered, the recommendations regarding protein intake could be\nsummarized as: 1. Consume an adequate daily amount (2.2–3.0 g/kg BW); 2. Select the\neating pattern that generates the greatest adherence in the person, with 3–6 feedings in\nwhich the amount of protein is≥0.4 g PRO/kg BW, using sources of high biological value,\nthus ensuring a leucine intake≥2.5 g [4]; 3. Carry out one protein feeding within 2–3 h\nbefore training and another within 2–3 h after training [118].\n7. Micronutrients\nThe available literature on the intake of micronutrients by resistance-trained athletes\nduring a weight loss phase is scarce. In weightlifters, an intake below the recommended\ndaily allowance (RDA) of vitamins B1, B3, B6, and B9 and magnesium [136], as well as a\ndeficiency in the consumption of magnesium, calcium and potassium [137] has been described.\nIn 2014, Helms et al. [4] highlighted the nutritional deficiencies in the diets of body-\nbuilders, based on previous observational studies in which the amounts of vitamin D,\ncalcium, zinc, magnesium and iron ingested did not reach the recommended values. How-\never, the authors underlined the need for more studies since those available were more\nthan three decades old and may not be representative of the current population of body-\nbuilders.

[140] reported that 31%\nof the United States population is at risk of deficiency in at least one vitamin, or has anemia.\nDietary supplement non-users had the highest risk of any deficiency (40%), while this risk\nin MVM consumers was substantially lower (14%). If a nutritional deficiency is suspected\nor detected, the first option should be to try to correct it by improving the nutritional\npattern; if this is not possible, the deficient vitamin or mineral should be supplemented\nspecifically in the appropriate amount. Nevertheless, routine or prophylactic use of low-\ndose MVM (most nutrients dosed at or near the RDI) is still worth considering, due to\nwidespread subpar micronutrient intakes across various populations. The potential benefits\nof MVM should not be dismissed or ignored [141]. Even when a diet is well planned, it\nis still not always possible to meet all of the recommended intakes of the full range of\nessential micronutrients.  In those cases of low energy intake, where even the intake of\nvegetables, fruits and other foods with high nutrient density may be reduced, the intake\nof multivitamins could alleviate potential inadequacies.  A relatively recent review by\nWard [142] is worth quoting directly: “When deciding whether to recommend the use of\ndietary supplements, it is important to consider the benefit:risk ratio. Current data suggest\nminimal, if any, risk associated with MVM preparations containing 10 or more vitamins\nand minerals at recommended daily intake levels in healthy people and a possibility of\nmodest benefits that include a reduced risk of cancer and nuclear cataract, for a relatively\nlow financial cost”.\n8. Supplementation\nIn a phase of fat loss in resistance-trained athletes, the fundamental pillars are training\nwith loads,  nutrition,  rest and,  if carried out,  cardiovascular exercise,  although some\nsupplements could be useful.  The objective of this section is not to carry out a review\nof all the supplements used by resistance-trained athletes; instead, it is focused on the\nusefulness of the two supplements with the most proven efficacy in the scientific literature:\ncaffeine and creatine monohydrate.  For information regarding other supplements with\npossible applicability during the fat loss stage, these recent reviews on supplementation\nare recommended [77,143,144]. Whey protein is not included in this section since its use is\nmainly as one more source of protein in the diet; for more information, the recent review of\nthe ISSN regarding protein and exercise is recommended [61].\n8.1.

However, creatine as a supplement is marketed in many other\nforms: creatine citrate, creatine ethyl ester, alkaline creatine, creatine nitrate, etc. [145]. For\nall of them it is claimed that there is lower degradation or greater retention at the muscular\nlevel, but this has not been demonstrated [145], and the bioavailability of some of these\nalternative forms is even lower [146]. So, it is recommended to choose the most studied\nand cheapest form, such as creatine monohydrate.\nIn the context of this review,  the use of creatine to lose fat and maintain muscle\nmass relates mainly to its effects on the concentration of muscle phosphocreatine,  in-\ncreases in phosphocreatine resynthesis, the reduction of the muscle acidosis produced in\nhigh-intensity exercises, and muscle mass and strength gains [145]. This increase in phos-\nphocreatine deposits would sharply increase the ability to exercise at high intensity and\nthus would generate greater adaptations, allowing more work to be done during the series\nand leading to greater gains in strength, muscle mass, and/or performance as training\nquality increases [145]. In addition, athletes may benefit from creatine supplementation\nindirectly, since it has been observed that creatine supplementation in combination with\nstrength training could increase the training-induced proliferation of satellite cells and\nmyonuclei in skeletal muscle, resulting in increased muscle fiber growth [147].\nWith a regular diet, creatine stores are at 60–80% saturation; therefore, creatine intake\nthrough supplementation would serve to increase muscle creatine and phosphocreatine\nlevels by 20–40% [145]. There are several ways to reach these levels: for instance, using a\n5-day loading phase or through maintenance intake, reaching these values in 28 days.\nWith a load: 5–7 days in a row with 0.30 g/kg BW of creatine monohydrate, divided\ninto 4 intakes throughout the day. Once the muscle creatine levels have been saturated, the\nintake of creatine monohydrate is reduced to maintenance (3–5 g/day).\nWithout a load:  daily intake of 3–5 g/day, up to 5–10 g/day in larger athletes of\ncreatine monohydrate, reaching saturation of muscle creatine levels in 28 days; the time of\nday at which it is taken is not important in terms of the long-term results [145].\nWith regard to the benefits of creatine supplementation in the long term, neither the\ntiming, nor its combination with CHO intake, nor the carry out of the loading phase are\nfactors that will influence the improvement in sports performance.  The loading phase\nwould only be recommended in those cases in which saturation of phosphocreatine stores is\nrequired in a short period of time; for example, if it is decided to start the supplementation\nin the middle of the FM loss phase [145].\nFor a complete review of the literature regarding the use of creatine in different areas\nof performance and health,  it is recommended to read the recent document prepared\nby  the  ISSN  that  details  its  position  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  use  of  creatine\nsupplementation in exercise, sports, and medicine [145].\n8.2. Caffeine\nTogether with beta-alanine, caffeine is the most common supplement in the 100 best-\nselling commercial pre-workout products, their prevalences being 87% and 86%, respec-\ntively  [148].   Caffeine  is  a  stimulant,  which  can  be  found  in  nutritional  supplements,\nnaturally (in foods such as coffee, tea and chocolate), or added to energy drinks and soft\ndrinks.  It has been shown to be effective as an ergogenic substance in both high- and\nmoderate-intensity exercises, and its possible use in periods of caloric restriction (to in-\ncrease energy expenditure) has been explored [77], although due to the magnitude of this\nincrease it may not translate into a long-term significant fat loss.\nThis review is concerned with the action of caffeine, taken through supplementation\nor in coffee, as a stimulant, which does not seem to be affected in chronic coffee or caffeine\nconsumers  [149].

These results were replicated in a trial conducted by the\nsame researchers [151].  The results obtained in terms of the ergogenic effect of caffeine\nappear to be similar when the same amount of caffeine is administered through coffee [150],\nalthough some aspects such as the large volume of liquid provided and the difficulties\nregarding quantification of the exact amount of caffeine ingested should be taken into\naccount [152].  The recommended dose to reduce fatigue is 1–3 mg/kg BW/day [149]\nand to improve performance in strength training it is 3–6 mg/kg BW/day, 30–60 min\nprior to exercise [77,153,154].  However, recent studies show the great inter-individual\nvariability in the response to different doses of caffeine, mediated by genetic and non-\ngenetic factors [155]; therefore, both the dose and the timing should be individualized for\neach athlete.\nOn a cautionary note, caffeine has the potential to interfere with the ergogenic effects\nof creatine [156]. Possible mechanisms include gastrointestinal upset as well as opposing\nactions on muscle relaxation time, via opposing effects on calcium kinetics [157]. However,\nthe concern of caffeine and creatine’s incompatibility has been challenged by ergogenic\neffects of creatine mixed with coffee [158] and tea [158], as well as the multi-ingredient\nsupplements containing both caffeine and creatine, yet consistently improving exercise\nperformance and increasing lean mass [159,160].\n9. Conclusions and Practical Applications\nResistance-trained athletes undergoing a weight loss phase should focus their efforts\non maximizing FFM retention while reducing the fat mass.  The caloric intake should\nbe set based on a target BW loss of 0.5–1.0%/week in order to maximize retention of\nFFM. The lower the % body fat of the athlete, the more conservative should the energy\ndeficit be.  The recommended protein intake is 2.2–3.0 g/kg BW/day, distributing this\nthroughout the day in three–six meals and ensuring in each of them an adequate amount\nof protein(0.40–0.55 g/kg BW/intake). The carbohydrate intake should be adapted to the\nathlete’s activity level in order to promote performance during training (2–5 g/kg BW/day).\nIndividuals who wish to engage in more severe CHO restriction (e.g., ketogenic conditions)\nmay increase the risk of FFM loss, despite a similar capacity to preserve strength. Once\nthe protein and carbohydrate intake has been established, the rest of the calories can be\nassigned to fat, ensuring a minimum intake of≥0.5 g/kg BW/day.  Regarding protein\ntiming, an intake 2–3 h before training and another 2–3 h post-training is preferable. The\nintake of caffeine (3–6 mg/kg BW/day) and creatine monohydrate (3–5 g/day, up to 5–10\ng/day in larger athletes) could be incorporated into the athlete’s diet due to the ergogenic\neffects related to resistance-training. Specific vitamin supplementation should be limited\nto special situations in which there is the detection of, or high risk for deficiency—and\nthe athlete cannot consume the recommended daily amount of these nutrients through\ndietary sources. Routine MVM use remains controversial but its benefits likely outweigh\nits risks. The main limitation of this review is the small number of long-term studies with\nlarge samples conducted on resistance-trained athletes during a weight loss phase. More\nresearch is required in this population in order to expand our knowledge and improve\nnutritional and dietary supplement recommendations. Table 1 summarizes the conclusions\nof each subsection.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/fat_loss.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Achieving an Optimal Fat Loss Phase in Resistance-Trained Athletes: A Narrative Review","Author":"Carlos Ruiz-Castellano, Sergio Espinar, Carlos Contreras, Fernando Mata, Alan A.

Regarding training variables, the most\neffective values are widely described in the literature.  However, there is still a lack of consensus\nregarding  the  efficiency  of  advanced  RT  techniques  and  methods  in  comparison  to  traditional\napproaches. Methods: MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from 1996 to September\n2019 for all studies investigating the effects of advanced RT techniques and methods on muscle\nhypertrophy and training variables. Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria and were consequently\nincluded for the quality assessment and data extraction. Results: Concerning the time-efficiency of\ntraining, the use of agonist–antagonist, upper–lower body supersets, drop and cluster sets, sarcoplasma\nstimulating training, employment of fast, but controlled duration of eccentric contractions (~2s),\nand high-load RT supplemented with low-load RT under blood flow restriction may provide an\nadditional stimulus and an advantage to traditional training protocols.  With regard to the higher\ndegree of mechanical tension, the use of accentuated eccentric loading in RT should be considered.\nImplementation of drop sets, sarcoplasma stimulating training, low-load RT in conjunction with\nlow-load RT under blood flow restriction could provide time-efficient solutions to increased metabolic\nstress.  Conclusions:  Due to insufficient evidence, it is difficult to provide specific guidelines for\nvolume, intensity of effort, and frequency of previously mentioned RT techniques and methods.\nHowever, well-trained athletes may integrate advanced RT techniques and methods into their routines\nas an additional stimulus to break through plateaus and to prevent training monotony.\nKeywords:muscle growth; drop sets; supersets; accentuated eccentric work; blood flow restriction;\npre-exhaustion; sarcoplasma stimulating training; movement tempo\n1. Introduction\nResistance training (RT) is a primary exercise intervention used to develop strength and stimulate\nmuscle  hypertrophy.    Increases  in  muscle  mass  constitute  key  components  of  conditioning  in\nvarious sports due to the correlation between muscle cross-sectional area and muscle strength [1,2].\nAdditionally, an increase in muscle mass is one of the goals of bodybuilding [3], and many recreationally\nstrength-trained individuals. Furthermore, adequate levels of muscle mass are an important issue from\na health standpoint because its low levels are associated with increased risks of several diseases such\nas cardiovascular disease [4] and cardio-metabolic risk in adolescents [5] as well as type II diabetes in\nmiddle aged and older adults [6].\nMuscle hypertrophy occurs when muscle protein synthesis exceeds muscle protein breakdown\nand results in positive net protein balance in cumulative periods [7].  This could be achieved with\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

From the nutrition point of view, protein intake alongside RT is a\npotent stimulus for muscle protein synthesis. With regard to RT, manipulation of its variables such\nas intensity and volume of effort, exercise order, number of performed repetitions and sets, tempo\nof movement, and the duration of rest periods between sets and exercises and training status have\nbeen extensively explored and discussed to maximize muscle adaptations [9,10]. Volume and intensity\nof effort are basic components with a direct impact on muscular adaptations [11,12]. The American\nCollege  of  Sports  Medicine  (ACSM)  recommends  1−3  sets  per  exercise  of  8−12  repetitions  with\n70−85% of one repetition maximum (1RM) for novice and 3−6 sets of 1−12 repetitions with 70−100%\n1RM for advanced individuals [13].  However, the recent literature shows a much wider range of\ntraining options.  Several studies have found that training with low-loads (30−60% 1RM) results in\nsimilar hypertrophy to training with moderate and high-loads (>60% 1RM) when volitional fatigue\noccurs [11,14–16]. Moreover, reaching volitional fatigue at all times is not necessary to make significant\ngains in hypertrophy [17], especially when training with high-loads is considered [18].  Evidence\nindicates that significant muscle growth occurs when the majority of training sets are performed with\n~3–4 repetitions in reserve (with moderate to high-loads) [19]. Furthermore, it has been established\nthat the volume of RT, defined as the total number of repetitions (repetitions x sets), together with\nloads used for a given exercise, is the key element of adaptation in terms of muscle hypertrophy;\nmoreover, it has been suggested that higher volumes of effort are warranted for maximizing muscle\ngrowth response in diverse populations [12,20–23]. However, following years of training, it becomes\ndifficult to induce further muscle hypertrophy [24], therefore individuals seek advanced resistance\ntraining techniques.\nThe purpose of the present paper was to provide an objective and critical review related to advanced\nRT methods and techniques influencing skeletal muscle, which may contribute to maximizing muscle\nhypertrophy in both recreational and competitive athletes.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Literature Search\nMEDLINE and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from 1996 to September 2019 for all studies\ninvestigating the effects of advanced resistance training techniques and methods on muscle hypertrophy\nand training variables. The search was performed using the following keyword combinations: (‘strength\ntraining’ OR ‘resistance training’ OR ‘hypertrophy training’ OR ‘muscle’) AND (‘time under tension’\nOR ‘movement velocity’ OR ‘eccentric overload’ OR ‘accentuated eccentric’ OR ‘blood flow restriction’\nOR ‘blood flow restricted’ OR occlusion OR ‘cluster set’ OR ‘superset OR ‘agonist-antagonist’ OR\n‘pre-exhaustion’ OR ‘drop set’ OR ‘sarcoplasma’ OR ‘advanced training techniques’ OR ‘cross-sectional\narea’  OR  ‘eccentric  duration’).   The  present  review  includes  studies  that  (1)  presented  original\nresearch data on healthy adult participants in an age range of 19−44 years old; (2) were published\nin peer-reviewed journals; and (3) were published in the English language. No sex restrictions were\nimposed during the search stage.\n2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nResearch studies investigating the effects of advanced resistance training techniques and methods\non muscle hypertrophy and training variables were the primary focus of the literature search. Early\nscreening of the articles was based on titles and abstracts. A total of 1088 studies were initially identified\nfor further scrutiny.\nThe next step was to select studies with respect to their internal validity:  (1) comparison of\ndifferent advanced RT techniques and methods with the RT programs performed in traditional training\nprotocols, (2) muscle hypertrophy and/or muscle strength and/or training volume were assessed pre-\nand post-intervention; for muscle hypertrophy both muscle cross-sectional area changes (magnetic","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/maximizing_hypertrophy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iText® 7.1.1 ©2000-2018 iText Group NV (AGPL-version)","CreationDate":"D:20191206031950+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20191206031950+01'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":2}}}],["1ecf909b-fc66-45b1-a1bd-196bb8a0e1dc",{"pageContent":"Int.

J. Environ. Res. Public Health2019,16, 48976 of 14\n3. Discussion\n3.1. Training Considerations\nThree major factors are emphasized in the conventional hypertrophy model: mechanical tension,\nmetabolic stress, and muscle damage [55].  These factors can occur by optimal manipulation of RT\nvariables and through a wide range of RT techniques.  Progressive mechanical tension overload is\nconsidered one of the major factors of muscle growth and changes in muscle architecture, which are\nattained by increasing RT intensity of effort.  RT with high-loads (>85% 1RM), and a low number\nof repetitions (1−5) as well as long rest intervals (~3−5 min) is largely oriented toward a greater\nmagnitude of mechanical tension, which primarily develops strength, while muscle hypertrophy is\ncompromised [13]. RT with a lower number of repetitions, yet with high-loads emphasizes mechanical\ntension and results in high levels of neural recruitment (fast-twitch muscle fibers).  Another critical\nvariable influencing hypertrophy with an evidenced dose-response relationship is RT volume [11,56].\nHigher RT volume (28−30 sets/muscle/week) is associated with greater increases in hypertrophy\ncompared to lower volume (6−10 sets/muscle/week) in both untrained and trained populations [12,20].\nImplementation of training with moderate number of repetitions (~6−12), multiple sets (3−6), moderate\nloads (60−80% 1RM), and short rest intervals (60 s) between sets elicits greater metabolic stress (in\ncontrast with high-loads), which appears to be a potent stimulus for inducing muscle hypertrophy [57].\nHowever, as long as RT is performed to volitional fatigue, training load might not affect exercise-induced\nmuscle  growth.   Findings  by  Schoenfeld  et  al.  [11]  indicate  that  both  low-load  RT  (≤60%  1RM)\nperformed to volitional fatigue and moderate-load RT (>60% 1RM) elicit significant increases in muscle\nhypertrophy among well-trained young men. However, the participants following the low-load RT\nprotocol performed approximately three times the total training volume compared to the high-load\ngroup (sets×repetitions).  Similar findings were also demonstrated in a study by Ikezoe et al. [58],\nwhich highlighted the importance of performing exercise to volitional fatigue when low-loads were\nused to maximize muscle hypertrophy outcomes.  These authors compared increments in muscle\nthickness (rectus femoris) after eight weeks of training with low-load, higher volume (30% 1RM, 12 sets\nx 8 repetitions) to training with high-load, lower volume (80% 1RM, 3 sets x 8 repetitions) leg extensions\nin young men. Considering that the training volume in the high-load group was significantly lower\nthan that in the low-load, the degree of muscle thickness attained after intervention was almost twice as\nhigh in the high-load group [58]. However, it should be noted that if RT is not conducted to volitional\nfatigue, reaching the minimum RT intensity threshold (>60%1RM) is necessary to maximize muscle\nhypertrophy [59].\nFurthermore, implementation of advanced RT techniques could provide an additional stimulus\nto  break  through  plateaus  for  trained  subjects  [24]  and  prevent  excessive  monotony  in  training.\nThe most recent RT techniques and methods frequently used by practitioners and coaches include\naccentuated eccentric loading, prolonged eccentric tempo, cluster sets, high-load RT combined with\nlow-load RT under blood flow restriction, supersets, drop sets, pre-exhaustion, and sarcoplasma\nstimulating training.\n3.2. Tempo Eccentric Technique\nOne of the advanced RT techniques is based on a prolonged duration of the eccentric phase\nof the movement.  The duration of each repetition can be identified by movement tempo, which is\ndetermined by four digits (e.g., 2/0/1/0) corresponding to the duration (in seconds) of particular phases\nof movement (eccentric, transition, concentric, transition) [30]. Changes in the movement tempo during\nRT impacts the maximal number of repetitions performed in a set, the maximal time under tension,\nand the final exercise volume [25–27]. Several studies have indicated that the use of a faster movement\ntempo (e.g., 2/0/2/0) results in a significant increase in the maximal number of performed repetitions\nwhen compared to the slower tempo (e.g., 6/0/2/0) [25–27]. In contrast, a slower tempo of movement,\nespecially during the eccentric phase (e.g., 6/0/2/0), decreases the number of performed repetitions, but","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/maximizing_hypertrophy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iText® 7.1.1 ©2000-2018 iText Group NV (AGPL-version)","CreationDate":"D:20191206031950+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20191206031950+01'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":6}}}],["cbf1cdd6-7aca-42e8-a211-d21c96c6f1c6",{"pageContent":"Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2019,16, 48977 of 14\nextends the time under tension, which may contribute to greater muscle hypertrophy [28].  On the\nother hand, a meta-analysis of Schoenfeld et al. [60] indicates that similar hypertrophic responses occur\nwhen the duration of repetitions ranges from 0.5 to 8 s, although it must be noted that they [60] did\nnot control the duration of particular phases of movement (eccentric vs.  concentric), thus making\nit difficult to draw definite conclusions. Furthermore, a study by Shibata et al. [29] showed that the\ndominant leg thigh cross-sectional area increased in a similar manner following both the slow (4 s) and\nthe fast (2 s) eccentric phase during the back squat exercise performed to volitional fatigue in a group\nof male soccer players. In light of the greater force capacity of eccentric actions, and the fact that the\nenergy requirements are typically 4-fold smaller than during the concentric contraction of the same\nload [61], it would seem logical that lower metabolic stress may occur, which could limit the responses\nto this training technique.\nHowever, studies indicate a wide range of manipulation of the duration of the eccentric phase of\nmovement can be employed if the primary goal of training is to maximize muscle hypertrophy [29,60].\nAlthough,  it is not currently clear whether slow tempo provides a superior stimulus for muscle\nhypertrophy, from a practical point of view, employing a fast but controlled duration of the eccentric\nphase  (~2s)  may  allow  for  a  high  time-efficiency  of  training  and  prevent  the  excessive  time  of\ntraining sessions.\n3.3. Accentuated Eccentric Loading Method\nAnother useful method that can be used during RT, based on eccentric contractions includes\naccentuated eccentric loading (AEL). This training strategy is based on the muscles’ ability to generate\ngreater force during maximal eccentric (~20−60%) versus other types of contraction. The use of weight\nreleasers allow for overloading the muscles during the eccentric phase of movement due to its specific\nconstruction. The weight can be unloaded in the transition from the eccentric to the concentric phase\nof movement.   The use of high-loads during the eccentric phase of movement is associated with\nsignificant exercise induced muscle damage and mechanical tension, which have been associated with\na hypertrophic response [55]. Furthermore, some studies have shown that performing eccentric-only\ncontractions led to higher gains in muscle mass when compared to concentric-only actions [30,62].\nNonetheless, recent literature has indicated that when the volume of training was matched, both AEL\nand high-load RT led to similar hypertrophic responses in groups of strength-trained athletes [31,32,63].\nFurthermore, RT protocols that did not promote significant muscle damage still induced similar muscle\nhypertrophy in comparison with those protocols that promoted initial muscle damage [7]. However,\ndifferences appear in muscle architecture adaptations.  Training with the concentric-only phase led\nto muscle growth mainly by the addition of sarcomeres in parallel (increased pennation angle with\nlittle change in fascicle length), while training with eccentric-only contractions led by the addition of\nsarcomeres in series (increased fascicle length and a small increase in the pennation angle) [64].\nFurthermore, due to the greater mechanical tension, it could provide an additional hypertrophic\nstimulus [31,33,65].  Although it must be noted that the main disadvantage of this technique is the\nnecessity of weight releasers or the presence of experienced spotters during training. Moreover AEL,\nrequires the eccentric load to reload after every repetition, thus is possible that the inter-repetition rest\nmay excessively extend the time of particular repetitions and the whole training session.\n3.4. Low-Load Resistance Training Under Blood Flow Restriction\nAnother RT method that allows for the avoidance of high mechanical stress associated with\nhigh-load RT and the high training volumes required when exercising with low-loads to volitional\nfatigue is to combine RT under blood flow restriction (BFR) [34,66,67]. The BFR method involves the\napplication of a restrictive device (a tourniquet, an inflatable cuff, or elastic wraps) on the proximal\npart of the limb to reduce the arterial blood flow and to occlude the venous return [67].  Such an\nintervention results in an accumulation of metabolic products distal to the restriction and when coupled\nwith RT, drastically increases metabolic stress.  However, with regard to low-load RT under BFR, a","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/maximizing_hypertrophy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iText® 7.1.1 ©2000-2018 iText Group NV (AGPL-version)","CreationDate":"D:20191206031950+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20191206031950+01'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":7}}}],["04a5b7e4-f6f8-4f58-b43e-0b8d329f0076",{"pageContent":"Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2019,16, 48978 of 14\nsignificant increase in the muscle cross-sectional area was observed even without reaching volitional\nfatigue in particular sets [35]. Furthermore, several studies have suggested that increases in muscle\nmass following low-load RT under BFR (20−30% 1RM) do not exceed those observed after the use\nof high-load RT (80% 1RM) without BFR [36–38].  The effectiveness of using BFR concerns various\npopulations such as non-athletes [39,40], moderately experienced participants (>1 year) [36], and elite\nathletes [41,42]. High-load RT with additional low-load sets under BFR may elicit beneficial muscular\nresponses in healthy athletes [68].\nThe most frequently and evidence-based repetition and set scheme involves 30 repetitions in\nthe first set followed by three sets of 15 repetitions with 30 s rests in between with 20−40% 1RM and\npressure, which contribute to 40−80% of arterial occlusion pressure [69]. However, it must be noted\nthat BFR induced muscle growth is limited to the limb muscles [43].\n3.5. Cluster Sets Technique\nAnother RT technique that partly allows for the balance of both mechanical tension and metabolic\nstress consists of cluster sets. In a traditional scheme of sets, repetitions, a chosen group of exercises\nare performed consecutively, with a long inter-set rest interval, are then followed by another set of\nrepetitions. On the contrary, cluster sets include short, inter-set rest intervals (20−60s) with a lower\nnumber of repetitions [70]. Previous research has mostly investigated the effects of cluster sets on force\nproduction, power output, and movement velocity, while findings related to muscle hypertrophy are\nlimited [44]. Nevertheless, implementation of inter-set rest intervals allows for a greater RT volume to\nbe achieved for a particular external load when compared with a traditional scheme of sets [44,45]\nin trained and untrained men, possibly providing an additional stimulus for muscle hypertrophy.\nHowever, it should be noted that cluster sets induce less metabolic stress, but greater emphasis is placed\non mechanical stress due to the use of higher training intensities of effort in comparison with traditional\nsets [44–46,71]. Thus, the implementation of cluster sets with short inter-set rest intervals could be a\nuseful strategy to carry out high-volume sessions of high-loads, while keeping a high time-efficiency of\ntraining (training volume/time). Furthermore, cluster sets may serve as an alternative to traditional sets\nfor promoting muscle hypertrophy over time during parallel periodization models [46], and prevent\nmonotony in training. Moreover, future studies should investigate the direct effects of cluster sets on\nexercise-induced muscle growth.\n3.6. Supersets and Pre-exhaustion Technique\nSupersets  and  pre-exhaustion  during  RT  can  be  defined  as  a  pair  of  different  exercise  sets\nperformed without rest.  Supersets most commonly consist of two exercises for the same muscle\ngroup [47], agonist-antagonist muscles [48,72] or alternating upper and lower body muscle groups [49]\nconsecutively followed by a recovery period; pre-exhaustion involves performing a single-joint before\na multi-joint exercise for the same muscle group (e.g., dumbbell fly before the bench press).  In a\nstudy by Wallace et al. [47], supersets (flat bench press followed by the incline bench press) resulted in\na significantly lower volume of training than a traditional exercise order in strength-trained males.\nHowever, with regard to agonist–antagonist supersets, investigation by Robbins et al. [48] (bench pull\npaired with the bench press) indicated a significantly higher training volume when compared to a\ntraditional exercise order. Furthermore, this type of superset as well as upper–lower body supersets\nwere found to be more time-efficient than traditional exercise order sessions [48,49].\nThe pre-exhaustion technique is commonly used by bodybuilders seeking to enhance the muscle\ngrowth of target muscles.  The rationale for this technique is that performing a single-joint exercise\nfirst fatigues the agonist in isolation, thereby placing greater stress on the agonist and increasing\nits activation during multi-joint exercise and potentiating its hypertrophy [73]. Another variation is\nthe reverse pre-exhaustion (e.g., triceps pushdown before the bench press), and the justification for\nthis approach is that the fatigued synergist contributes less to the subsequent multi-joint exercise,\nthereby placing greater stress on the agonist group [74]. However, a study by Golas et al. [75] partially","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/maximizing_hypertrophy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iText® 7.1.1 ©2000-2018 iText Group NV (AGPL-version)","CreationDate":"D:20191206031950+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20191206031950+01'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":8}}}],["2cd2478c-e201-494b-8a7f-515cd42dbb7a",{"pageContent":"Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2019,16, 48979 of 14\ndisagreed with this statement as the results indicated that a pre-exhaustion exercise (incline dumbbell\nfly) did not affect the pectoralis major activity during the flat bench press exercise at 95% 1RM. Despite\nthat, pre-exhaustion of the synergist muscles (triceps brachii and anterior deltoid before the bench\npress) led to their higher activation during the multi-joint movement (bench press) as compared to the\nbaseline [75]. Furthermore, results of a study by Soares et al. [50] suggested that pre-exhaustion (triceps\npushdown followed by the bench press) decreased the maximal number of repetitions performed\nduring a set to volitional fatigue.\nIn conclusion, practitioners aiming to maximize training volume and intensity of effort may be\nwell advised to consider the use of supersets (agonist–antagonist and upper–lower body) in their RT\nprograms. The use of these exercise orders may be more time-efficient than the traditional approach,\nand especially useful when time limitations exist in the planning of training sessions.\n3.7. Drop Sets and Sarcoplasma Stimulating Training Technique\nDrop sets involve performing a set to volitional fatigue with a given load and then immediately\nreducing the load (e.g., ~20%) and continuing the exercise until subsequent volitional fatigue [76].\nBriefly, the rationale for this technique is high metabolic stress induced due to a high number of\nrepetitions performed with short rest intervals.   Accordingly,  a study by Fink et al. [51] showed\nsignificantly higher muscle thickness after drop sets in comparison with RT following a traditional sets\nscheme, which can be considered as a potential marker for metabolic stress [57]. Furthermore, results\nof the study by Fink et al. [51] showed significant increases in the triceps cross-sectional area after six\nweeks of drop sets training when compared to traditional sets.  Nevertheless, it must be noted that\nparticipants taking part in this research were recreational trained persons with little experience in RT\n(did not regularly train for more than one year). On the other hand, Angleri et al. [52] demonstrated\nthat drop sets did not promote greater lower body muscle growth when compared with traditional\nsets in well-trained males when training volume was equalized.\nSimilarly to drop sets, sarcoplasm stimulating training (SST) consists of sets of exercises performed\nat 70–80% 1RM to volitional fatigue and then repeating this protocol twice more with 20 s rest intervals\nin between. The next step is to reduce the external load by 20% and perform an additional set with\na 4/0/1/0 tempo; following a 20 s rest interval, 20% of the external load is reduced again, and a set\nwith 4/0/1/0 tempo is completed to volitional fatigue. In the last set, the load is further decreased by\n20% and after its completion, following a 20 s rest interval, a static hold is performed (e.g., at 90\n◦\nof\nelbow flexion) to volitional fatigue [53]. Another SST variation refers to the performance of eight sets\nof exercises at 70−80% 1RM to volitional fatigue with programmed rest intervals between subsequent\nsets (45, 30, 15, 5, 5, 15, 30, and 45 s) without reducing the load [53]. Similarly, to drop sets, the main\naim of SST is to induce high metabolic stress [53]. Recently, de Almeida et al. [53] demonstrated that\nSST resulted in greater acute biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscle thickness when compared to a\ntraditional set scheme in trained subjects, even when total training volume was higher in a traditional\nset scheme RT.\nEvidence suggests the beneficial effects of both drop sets and SST in acute increases in triceps\nbrachii muscle thickness [53] in both amateur and well-trained subjects, even with lower training\nvolume versus a traditional set scheme RT. However, studies that have investigated the chronic effects\nof drop sets did not show a superior hypertrophy response when compared with traditional sets [52,54].\nMoreover, the chronic effects of SST on muscle growth have not been examined yet.\n3.8. Limitations\nThe present review has several limitations that should be addressed. The majority of included\nstudies did not control nutritional intake, which can affect the magnitude of muscle adaptations.\nAnother limitation relates to studies that examined the influence of advanced methods and techniques\non training variables, but did not analyze hypertrophic responses and/or strength improvements,","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/maximizing_hypertrophy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iText® 7.1.1 ©2000-2018 iText Group NV (AGPL-version)","CreationDate":"D:20191206031950+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20191206031950+01'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":9}}}],["288b8cbe-f334-43c6-8be8-9b4d82ee5544",{"pageContent":"Int.

In addition, only one study [44] directly\ncompared the responses between trained and untrained participants.\n4. Conclusions\nConsidering the aforementioned studies, effective hypertrophy-oriented training should comprise\na combination of mechanical tension and metabolic stress. In summary, foundations for individuals\nseeking to maximize muscle growth should be hypertrophy-oriented RT consisting of multiple sets\n(3−6) of six to 12 repetitions with short rest intervals (60 s) and moderate intensity of effort (60−80%\n1RM) with subsequent increases in training volume (12–28 sets/muscle/week) [20]. Moreover, trained\nathletes may consider integrating advanced resistance training techniques and methods to provide\nan additional stimulus to break through plateaus, prevent monotony, and reduce the time of training\nsessions. Evidence suggests some beneficial effects for selected RT techniques especially in the case\nof training volume, time-efficiency, and intensity of effort. Furthermore, even though most of these\ntechniques and methods did not show a superior hypertrophy response compared to the traditional\napproach, it may serve as an alternative to prevent monotony or it could improve readiness to training\nsessions.  To maintain high time-efficiency of training and when time limitations exist, the use of\nagonist–antagonist, upper–lower body supersets, drop sets, SST, and cluster sets may provide an\nadvantage to the traditional approach. Furthermore, the employment of fast but controlled tempo (~2 s)\nand supplementation of high-load RT with low-load RT under BFR may allow for high time-efficiency of\ntraining and prevent excessively long training sessions. With regard to the higher degree of mechanical\ntension, the use of AEL in RT should be considered, therefore, in cases where time is limited, cluster\nsets might be a better choice.  The implementation of drop sets, SST, and low-load RT under BFR\ncould provide time-efficient techniques to increase metabolic stress. In summary, currently there is not\nsufficient evidence to provide specific guidelines for volume, intensity of effort, and frequency of the\npreviously mentioned resistance training techniques.\nFurthermore, persistence in training and diet is essential.  Recently, research has shown that\nmuscle hypertrophy that occurs at initial stages of RT (~4 sessions) is mostly attributable to muscle\ndamage induced cell swelling with the majority of strength gains resulting from neural adaptations\n(8−12 sessions).  Within the latter phase of RT (6−10 weeks), muscle growth begins to become the\ndominant factor [7].\nAuthor Contributions:Study concept and design: M.K. and G.W.; Acquisition of data: M.K. and G.W.; Analysis\nand interpretation of data: M.K. and G.W.; Writing—original draft: M.K.; Writing—review and editing: A.G. and\nM.W.; Supervision: A.G. and M.W.\nFunding:This research received no external funding.\nAcknowledgments:The study was supported and funded by the statutory research project of the Jerzy Kukuczka\nAcademy of Physical Education in Katowice, Poland.\nConflicts of Interest:\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or\nfinancial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\nReferences\n1.Herman, J.R.;  Rana, S.R.;  Chleboun, G.S.;  Gilders, R.M.;  Hageman, F.C.;  Hikida, R.S.;  Kushnick, M.R.;\nRagg, K.E.; Staron, R.S.; Toma, K.

Introduction\nOptimal performance is a primary objective for many athletes, and this can be attained\nby following a suitable exercise protocol and ensuring proper nutrition [1]. Food is com-\nposed of nutrients that are essential for growth, repair, and energy generation depending\non the amount that meets the body’s need [2]. Nutrients are typically categorized into two\nmain groups:  micronutrients and macronutrients [3].  When it comes to athletic perfor-\nmance, the importance of micronutrients should not be neglected [4]. Athletes are prone\nto consuming insufficient amounts of micronutrients due to inappropriate dietary habits,\nespecially if they are not matching their physical activity requirements [5].  By making\nsure they are receiving adequate levels of micronutrients, athletes can give themselves a\ncompetitive edge and maximize the potential of their training [6].

Therefore, athletes, nutritionists, and coaches\nmust work together to customize nutritional plans for each athlete to ensure that their\nathletes/players’ needs are considered properly and they are receiving the sufficient level of\nnutrients they need to aid in the adaptation to their training and ultimately support optimal\nathletic performance. The evaluation of the evidence of the impact of micronutrients on the\nperformance of athletes is the main purpose of this comprehensive systematic review paper.\n2. Methods and Search Strategy\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted using the Web of Science, Scopus,\nand PubMed databases. In order to retrieve relevant studies on the topic, our search strategy\nincorporated keywords including “micronutrients”, “vitamins”, “minerals”,” antioxidants”,\n“athletes”,  “sport performance”,  “training”,  and “exercise”.   Original research articles\ninvolving human subjects, English-language publications, human subjects, and a focus on\nmicronutrients and athletic performance were the inclusion criteria.  For the systematic\nreview procedure, the Synthesis without meta-analysis (SWIM) recommendations were\nfollowed. The search was limited to articles published between January 1950 and 31 March\n2023.  The studies that made the cut for the review had to measure outcomes related to\nathletic performance, have a sample size of at least 10 participants, and use an intervention\ninvolving a micronutrient supplement. Studies that concentrated on macronutrients—such\nas carbohydrates and protein—were disregarded.\n2.1. Data Extraction\nStudies’ titles and abstracts located by the search were examined by two independent\nreviewers. After that, full-text articles were examined to see if they qualified for inclusion\nin the review. Data on the study design, sample size, intervention protocol, micronutrient\nsupplements used, athletic performance outcomes assessed, and outcomes were extracted\nfrom the eligible studies.\n2.2. Data Synthesis\nTo summarize the conclusions of the included studies,  a narrative synthesis was\ncarried out.  The studies’ findings were categorized by micronutrient supplement and\nathletic performance outcome measures.  A description of each study’s design, sample\nsize, intervention strategy, and findings was included in the synthesis. It is important to\nensure the accuracy and reliability of a systematic review by ensuring that all information is\nextracted in a standardized and consistent manner. In this study, two authors independently\nextracted all information from each paper to minimize the risk of bias and errors.  This\napproach helps to ensure the validity of the review’s findings and strengthens the overall\nquality of the study. By having two authors independently extract information from each\npaper, the review can ensure data accuracy and increase confidence in the conclusions\ndrawn from the analysis.  It is a rigorous method that is commonly used in systematic\nreviews and emphasizes the importance of transparency and objectivity in research [8].\n3. Results\nA total of 231 articles were obtained involving 18,683 athletes.  Table 1 provides a\nsummary of the main micronutrients researched in sports medicine.  Table 2 provides a\nsummary of all available 217 research articles about micronutrients and sports performance.\nFigure 1 simplified the model of micronutrients’ main functions in sports medicine.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/micronutrients.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine","Author":"Hadeel Ali Ghazzawi, Mariam Ali Hussain, Khadija Majdy Raziq, Khawla Khaled Alsendi, Reem Osama Alaamer, Manar Jaradat, Sondos Alobaidi, Raghad Al Aqili, Khaled Trabelsi and Haitham Jahrami","Subject":"The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to examine the effects of micronutrient intake on athletic performance and (ii) to determine the specific micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that offer the most significant enhancements in terms of athletic performance, with the goal of providing guidance to athletes and coaches in optimizing their nutritional strategies.

Vitamins\nVitamins are organic essential compounds that cannot be synthesized by the human\nbody [29]. They play a vital role in numerous functions that are relevant to the athlete’s\nperformance [7]. Their functions are evident in co-enzymes, hormones, and autoxidation,\nas well as their contribution to energy production [242]. There are thirteen various kinds\nof vitamins currently divided into two major groups due to their chemical and biological\nfunctions, four of which are fat-soluble vitamins (FSV) including vitamins A, D, E, and K,\nand the rest are water-soluble vitamins (WSV) including B complex vitamins and vitamin\nC [243]. Table 1 summarizes the recommendation requirements of vitamins along with the\nrich sources and their roles in exercise performance.\n5. Fat-Soluble Vitamins (FSV)\nVitamin A\nVitamin A plays a significant role in promoting the overall wellbeing of athletes, as it\naids in the formation of healthy tissues and improves oxygen access throughout the body,\nthereby supporting the maintenance of an adequate level of physical activity [3]. It also has\na crucial influence on vision, skin health, and immune system functioning [29]. Moreover,\nvitamin A is a potent antioxidant that helps in neutralizing free radicals generated by\noxidative stress during advanced physical training. The sufficient consumption of vitamin\nA may help alleviate the reactive oxygen species and avoid the onset of illnesses such as\nheart failure and muscle damage [244], as mentioned in many studies in Table 2.\nVitamin A mainly exists in two forms: animal source (retinol) and plant-based provita-\nmin A (carotenoids). The intake of sufficient amounts of beef liver, eggs, dairy products,\nand seafood as well as dark leafy green vegetables may ensure meeting the dietary require-\nments for athletes. It is noteworthy that athletes may benefit from supplementation with\nmultivitamins that contain vitamin A, as a part rather than its own sole use [29].","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/micronutrients.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine","Author":"Hadeel Ali Ghazzawi, Mariam Ali Hussain, Khadija Majdy Raziq, Khawla Khaled Alsendi, Reem Osama Alaamer, Manar Jaradat, Sondos Alobaidi, Raghad Al Aqili, Khaled Trabelsi and Haitham Jahrami","Subject":"The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to examine the effects of micronutrient intake on athletic performance and (ii) to determine the specific micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that offer the most significant enhancements in terms of athletic performance, with the goal of providing guidance to athletes and coaches in optimizing their nutritional strategies.

Furthermore, vitamin A can help protect athletes against injuries by\nincreasing healing times and promoting the formation of healthy connective tissues [3].\nFinally, vitamin A may help fight off colds, flu, and other illnesses, which can be particularly\nhelpful for traveling athletes.\nTo evaluate the effect of crocetin on fatigue, a study test was conducted by athletes to\nmeasure stamina using a bicycle ergometer at a standard workload for 120 min twice. They\nalso performed non-workload tests of 10 s at 30 min at a maximum velocity (MV) [242]. A\ndifference in MV from 30 to the 210 min test was remarkably reported only in men who\nconsumed crocetin when compared to their counterpart who used a placebo (p< 0.05) [248].\nNo difference was observed with the consumption of ascorbic acid in all candidates with\nthe same period [248]. The daily consumption of crocetin would reduce physical exhaustion\nin men, according to these results [179]. The attenuating effect of saffron carotenoids on\nmuscle fatigue is due to their provitamin A activity [248]. Athletes should meet their daily\nrecommended intake of vitamin A to guarantee a perfect peak physical condition [249].\nThe Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of retinol activity equivalents (mcg\nRAE), as shown in Table 1, is 900 micrograms for men aged 19 years old and older, equal to\n3000 international units (IU), and 700 mcg RAE for women aged 19 years old and older,\nequivalent to 2333 (IU). However, the adherence to a maximum Tolerable Upper Limit (UL)\nof 10,000 IU (3000 mcg)/day for adults is important to avoid any dangerous effect.  It is\nalso important to emphasize that toxicity may occur when frequent doses of more than\n25,000 IU are taken daily [3].\nβ-carotene is a member of the carotenoid family that is thought to provide numer-\nous health benefits, including immunity system boosting, antioxidation properties, and\nperformance enhancement [250].β-carotene is an essential antioxidant, meaning that it\nhelps prevent the harmful effect of free radicals on cells [251].  This is important for ath-\nletes, as free radicals are generated during strenuous exercise and can lead to fatigue and\nsoreness [176]. Several studies have reported similar findings, highlighting the ability of\nvitamin A to potentially reduce recovery time from exercise [7,250]\nSumac juice drink was tested in a study to evaluate its impact on pain scores through\npost-exercise intervals. Forty healthy candidates involved in an aerobic training protocol\nfor four weeks received a dose of placebo or sumac juice consumption two times/day\nfor a month. The results revealed that participants of the sumac juice group had a lower\npain score increment and even a better enhancement during pain relief.  The potency of\nprotecting muscles might be due to the sumac juice antioxidant potency ofβ-carotene-\nlinoleic acid components. These results highlight the possibility of sumac juice consumption\nin improving muscle performance among athletes [252]. Nevertheless, future studies of\nathletes are warranted.\nAthletes often push their bodies to the limit, therefore compromising their immune\nsystems and making them more susceptible to infections and illness [176]. Taking a sup-\nplement withβ-carotene may have potential benefits for the immune system, helping\nto prevent illness and potentially enabling athletes to train harder and longer [250,251].\nApparently healthy nonsmoker adult males were involved in consuming placebo or 15\nmg/day ofβ-carotene for 26 days. After oral administration, significant increases in the\nmonocytes percentage representing the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule\nhuman leukocyte antigen DR isotype (HLA-DR) and the adhesion molecules intercellular\nadhesion molecule-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen-3 were observed. Further-\nmore, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was notably elevated due to the dose intake,\narguing that a slight increment in the consumption of dietaryβ-carotene can enhance the\nresponses of immune cells within the short term, supporting the process of the carcinogenic\npotency [253].","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/micronutrients.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine","Author":"Hadeel Ali Ghazzawi, Mariam Ali Hussain, Khadija Majdy Raziq, Khawla Khaled Alsendi, Reem Osama Alaamer, Manar Jaradat, Sondos Alobaidi, Raghad Al Aqili, Khaled Trabelsi and Haitham Jahrami","Subject":"The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to examine the effects of micronutrient intake on athletic performance and (ii) to determine the specific micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that offer the most significant enhancements in terms of athletic performance, with the goal of providing guidance to athletes and coaches in optimizing their nutritional strategies.

Studies\nhave shown thatβ-carotene supplementation may lead to endurance strength improvement\nand injury risk prevention [3,150].  Similarly, a meta-analysis of nine studies including\nparticipants from both genders, with a total 190,545 candidates, emphasized thatβ-carotene\nleads to a significant enhancement in overall performance [29]. There was a 95% possibility\nthatβ-carotene consumption attenuates the possibility of hip fracture and other different\nfracture types by over 20% [251].  According to research, despite the uncertain effect of\nthe antioxidant’s supplementation, consumingβ-carotene and combining antioxidants or\nnot still has an effective impact in reducing exercise-induced peroxidation [33]. This may\nenhance athletes’ endurance in the long term [251,254,255].\n6. Vitamin E\nAs research progresses, the potential advantages of vitamin E for athletes are becoming\nincreasingly apparent.  Vitamin E helps in protecting athletes’ bodies and may improve\nboth performance and recovery [75].  Overtraining and intense exercise are associated\nwith reactive oxygen species (ROSs) production, which aids in enhanced muscular and\nendurance adaptation to exercise through the upregulation of endogenous antioxidant\nenzymes [256].  However, excess accumulation of ROS accompanied by the inability of\nthe body to scavenge these compounds is harmful to the body’s cell components which is\nassociated with fatigue, delayed recovery, and reduced performance [257]. Accordingly,\nresearch suggests the possible protective effects of vitamin E supplements against chronic\nstress associated with exercise [257,258]. This vitamin possesses antioxidant properties by\nneutralizing free radicals, protecting cells and tissues [257,258].\nStudies showed controversial results of vitamin E supplementation in athletes [44]. It\nwas shown that vitamin E supplements neither inhibit exercise-induced oxidative stress nor\nimpact endurance running performance [259]. Moreover, these results were supported by\nthe randomized controlled trial on athletic students where vitamin E oral consumption was\nfound to not influence exercise endurance [260]. On the other hand, among healthy indi-\nviduals, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) consumption inhibits the exercise-induced reduction\nin blood paraoxonase 1/arylesterase activity [6,44,147,260]. Excess doses of supplements\nhave been shown in studies to inhibit the signaling reactions required for adaptations to\nexercise, creating an interference effect [3].\nA meta-analysis revealed that vitamin E supplements have a beneficial and protective\neffect, particularly at low doses (≤500 IU/day), in reducing biomarkers associated with\nexercise-induced muscle damage and oxidative stress. Beneficial effects of the antioxidant\ncharacteristics of vitamin E were observed among exercise-induced side-effects [257]; both\nanimal and human studies have indicated that Vitamin E has the potential to enhance\nimmune function and provide protection against various infectious diseases [6]. Vitamin\nE reduces PGE2 production and inhibits COX2 activity, likely by decreasing nitric oxide\nproduction [261].  Furthermore, it improves T cells immune synapse formation and ac-\ntivation signals, and lastly, it helps in modulating the T (Th1/Th2) balance [52].  This is\nparticularly beneficial for athletes, who are often susceptible to illness and injury due to\nthe intense physical demands of their sport. By supplementing with vitamin E, athletes\ncan help increase the body’s natural immunity, thus reducing the risk of infection and\npromoting recovery [262].\nVitamin E may assist in improving blood flow, which is essential for athletes [242].\nγ-tocopherol, which is one of the compounds that contain vitamin E, increases cardiovas-\ncular functions.γ-tocopherol expands the activity of nitric oxide synthase, which in turn\nproduces nitric oxide, aiding in vessels relaxation and thus improving blood flow [29].\nAdequate levels of nutrients and oxygen concentrations in muscles indicate a raised blood\nflow rate, which may help improve performance [263]. Additionally, vitamin E improves\nred blood cells’ flow and flexibility [264]. This is important for athletes, as improved blood\nflow means better performance in delivering nutrients and oxygen to the muscles, allowing\nthem to perform at their best [176].","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/micronutrients.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine","Author":"Hadeel Ali Ghazzawi, Mariam Ali Hussain, Khadija Majdy Raziq, Khawla Khaled Alsendi, Reem Osama Alaamer, Manar Jaradat, Sondos Alobaidi, Raghad Al Aqili, Khaled Trabelsi and Haitham Jahrami","Subject":"The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to examine the effects of micronutrient intake on athletic performance and (ii) to determine the specific micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that offer the most significant enhancements in terms of athletic performance, with the goal of providing guidance to athletes and coaches in optimizing their nutritional strategies.

Misusing or consuming excessive\namounts of vitamins can lead to muscle fatigue and impede the recovery process due to the\ninactivation of the gene expression regulator Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor\n2), which plays a role in the response to cellular stress and contributes to enhancing exercise\nperformance [265]. It is worth noting that Vitamin E toxicity may cause increases in mortal-\nity risk factors, since there has been a positive relation accompanied by a high-sensitivity C\nreactive protein indicative of inflammation [266].\n7. Vitamin D\nVitamin D plays a cooperative role in the synthesis of various hormones in the body [3].\nDairy products, egg yolk, and fatty fish are the rich dietary intake sources [2]. Moreover, it\ncan be synthesizedin vivoand be activated by sunlight within a duration of 15 to 20 min of\nexposure [44]. It also plays an important role in calcium homeostasis and constant healthy\nbone [30], functions of improving the immune system, musculoskeletal system, power, and\nforce output [45].\nVitamin D supplementation has been increased among athletes [45]. Unfortunately,\nthe widespread vitamin D insufficiency has been clearly stated in elite male athletes, with\nevidence of a deficit in women [46].  Percentages of insufficiency in elite athletes were\nabove 50%, and the deficiency in other studies was 70–90%, as reported by Harju et al. [47].\nCertain circumstances impact vitamin D status, such as indoor training, pigmented skin,\nand living in a high-altitude region [48]. Studies have reported that athletes with vitamin\nD deficiency may experience ergogenic benefits when taking vitamin D supplements [103].\nThere was a direct relation between the concentrations of vitamin D and athletes’ per-\nformance, such as speed, jumps’ height, power muscle tone, and strength of handgrip [50].\nMoreover, the addition of calcium to vitamin D supplements exhibited a reduction in the\nstress fracture rate [106,138].\nIn a study conducted among 70 athletes randomly assigned for 8 weeks to either\nvitamin D oral supplements of 50,000 IU/week group or a control group, a significant im-\nprovement in the test of the strength leg press in both groups was reported [267]. However,\nthe results emphasized that the enhancement in the supplemented group was obviously\nmore noted than that in the control group (p= 0.034). Moreover, when the sprint test was\nconducted, within-group enhancement had been noticed in the supplemented group only\n(p= 0.030). The results showed that regular weekly vitamin D supplementation with a dose\nof 50,000 IU increased the levels of circulating calcidiol (major circulating form of vitamin\nD) by approximately 17 ng/mL. This increment was related to a notable enhancement in\nsprint and power leg examinations in the vitamin D group [138]\nAdditionally, vitamin D is also thought to improve the body’s utilization of carbo-\nhydrates during exercise, providing the body with increased energy, which can help to\nenhance performance [1]. Twenty-two male adult athletes were allocated into two groups\nfor 8 days: a one-shot dose of 150,000 IU vitamin D group and a placebo group. The vitamin\nD group showed a significant elevation in muscle power in the period from day 1 up to day\n8, suggesting that a single dose of 150 000 IU vitamin D had a beneficial impact on serum\n25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and the muscle’s role [268].\nTo maintain sufficient vitamin D levels, the most appropriate way is to spend time\nin outdoor direct sunlight for several minutes each day, as obviously indicated by many\nstudies’  conclusions  (see  Table  2).   This  prescription  for  sun  exposure  should  also  be\ncombined with foods that are rich in vitamin D, such as dairy products, fatty fish, and\nfortified foods [101].   Additionally,  athletes may also benefit from daily multivitamin","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/micronutrients.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine","Author":"Hadeel Ali Ghazzawi, Mariam Ali Hussain, Khadija Majdy Raziq, Khawla Khaled Alsendi, Reem Osama Alaamer, Manar Jaradat, Sondos Alobaidi, Raghad Al Aqili, Khaled Trabelsi and Haitham Jahrami","Subject":"The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to examine the effects of micronutrient intake on athletic performance and (ii) to determine the specific micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that offer the most significant enhancements in terms of athletic performance, with the goal of providing guidance to athletes and coaches in optimizing their nutritional strategies.

The recommended daily dose of vitamin D, as shown in Table 1, varies depending\non age; a daily dose of 600 IU (equivalent to 15 micrograms (mcg)) is considered sufficient\nfor the age of 19 and above in both genders, and for adults over 70 years old, an 800 IU\n(20 mcg) daily dose would be sufficient [7,25]. Vitamin D-deficient athletes would require\n50,000 IU of vitamin D per week for 8 weeks [138,258].\nA previous study was conducted for 12 weeks among 53 youth athlete swimmers\nwho suffered from insufficient levels of vitamin D to evaluate the influence of vitamin D\noral supplementation on physical performance by taking 2000 IU/day of vitamin D or\nplacebo. No notable difference was observed in performance between the supplemented\nand placebo groups [269]. The results concluded that there was no remarkable correlation\nfound between Vitamin D levels and the evaluated criteria including strength or swimming\nperformance and even the age-adjusted balance.   Although the oral administration of\nvitamin D had raised the concentration of Vitamin D compared to the placebo group, no\nsignificant physical performance enhancement was reported [269].\n8. Vitamin K\nVitamin K is essential for blood coagulation [163]. It may also impact bone metabolism\nin postmenopausal women, according to a few previous studies [3,7,270]. In elite female\nathletes, the oral intake of vitamin K at a dose of 10 mg/day has been shown to improve\nbone remodeling [254] by increasing the calcium-binding capacity of osteocalcin, promoting\nbone formation, and reducing bone resorption [176].  Moreover, the intake of vitamin K\nimproved cardiovascular function [18,231]. Table 1 summarized the recommendation and\nthe role of vitamin K in exercise performance.\n9. Water-Soluble Vitamins (WSV)\nVitamin B\nB-complex vitamins are essential for athletes to maintain optimal health and perfor-\nmance [19].  B-complex vitamins help athletes manage stress and anxiety, aid in muscle\nrecovery, and reduce fatigue, which may adversely affect performance if left unchecked [2].\nB-complex vitamins help in blood pressure regulation [271]. Moreover, B-complex vitamins\naid in maintaining a healthy sleep schedule by regulating levels of the sleep-regulating\nhormone melatonin, helping athletes fall in a deep continuous sleep [5]. This is essential for\nathletes, as the lack of sleep can affect an athlete’s performance [52]. B-complex vitamins\nalso contribute to maintaining optimal health and performance in athletes, supporting\nimproved brain functioning, concentration, sleep quality, and energy levels [19].  Thus,\nathletes need to ensure that they are receiving enough vitamin B through their diet or\nsupplements [244].\nThiamine (B1)is a water-soluble vitamin that must be consumed regularly from the\ndiet [6]. Although free thiamine is stable at acidic pH, it is destroyed by ultraviolet (UV)\nand gamma irradiation and is heat-sensitive [29]. Whole grains, bread, and nuts are the\nmost common thiamine food sources, while milled wheat flour, polished rice, vegetables,\nand fruits contain less thiamin [272]. The large intestine’s bacteria in the human body are\nable to produce thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) [52]. Thiamine leaches into\nthe water due to its solubility and is inevitably lost in any discarded soaking or cooking\nwater, as well as destroyed by heating during culinary methods [7].\nThiamine, in its active state (TPP), is a cofactor of numerous important enzymes in-\nvolved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and branched-chain amino acids [7]. Moreover,\nit is necessary for several other cellular functions, including the development of nucleic acid\nprecursors, myelin, and neurotransmitters (such as acetylcholine), as well as antioxidant\ndefense [272]. A deficiency of this vitamin leads to a decline in oxidative metabolism [265].\nThe biochemical outcomes include a failure to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), lactic\nacidosis resulting in a greater lactic acid generation, and a reduction in neurotransmit-\nter synthesis (e.g.,  acetylcholine,  glutamate,  aspartate,  and gamma-aminobutyric acid","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/micronutrients.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine","Author":"Hadeel Ali Ghazzawi, Mariam Ali Hussain, Khadija Majdy Raziq, Khawla Khaled Alsendi, Reem Osama Alaamer, Manar Jaradat, Sondos Alobaidi, Raghad Al Aqili, Khaled Trabelsi and Haitham Jahrami","Subject":"The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to examine the effects of micronutrient intake on athletic performance and (ii) to determine the specific micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that offer the most significant enhancements in terms of athletic performance, with the goal of providing guidance to athletes and coaches in optimizing their nutritional strategies.

The major causes of thiamin deficiency are either the insufficient intake, poor\nabsorption or metabolism, or an increase the body demand [265]. Furthermore, diuretics\nand diarrhea lead to thiamine deficiency [272]. Regarding thiamin and exercise, research\nsuggests that thiamin availability in the diet appears to influence exercise capacity when\nathletes consume the recommended amount [254].\nRiboflavin (B2)is the second vitamin from the B-complex vitamins [270]. It appears\nas a yellow-orange chemical molecule that is water-soluble [273]. Riboflavin is relatively\nheat- and oxygen-stable, especially in an acidic environment [19]. It is very light-sensitive,\ndestroyed by reducing agents, and unstable in alkaline solutions [4]. Riboflavin is essential\nand must be obtained from food sources [2]. Riboflavin is abundant in almonds, beef liver,\nsardines, mushrooms, cheddar cheese, and eggs [271]. When athletes consume a typical\namount of riboflavin, their exercise capability would be optimum [254].\nNiacin (B3)is the third water-soluble member of the B vitamins family [176]. Humans\ncan partially convert the essential amino acid tryptophan to nicotinamide, which is a dietary\nsupply of niacin [270]. However, the conversion cannot meet the demands for niacin, so\ndietary niacin supplies around 50% of the daily niacin requirement [256].  Meat, whole\ngrains, milk, and dairy products are good sources of niacin [242]. Niacin is abundant in\npeanuts, seafood, mushrooms, and yeasts [29]. Food items high in tryptophan-containing\nproteins, such as milk, cheese, and eggs, are good sources of niacin [7]. Its roles include\nreduction and oxidation (redox) processes, as well as acting as a ligand for a range of purine\nreceptors [243].\nIt is hypothesized that this vitamin lowers cholesterol, improves thermoregulation,\nand improves oxidative metabolism [274].  In hypercholesteremic individuals, a niacin\nintake of 100–500 mg/day may help lower blood lipid levels while increasing homocys-\nteine levels [176].  Nevertheless, consuming 280 mg of niacin during exercise has been\ndemonstrated to reduce exercise capacity by moderating fatty acid mobilization [275].\nPantothenic acid (B5)\nis a water-soluble vitamin that is widely available in the diet [3].\nIt is often provided as calcium pantothenate,  which is more stable against light,  heat,\nand oxygen,  but is unstable in both alkaline and acidic circumstances [273].   Sodium\npantothenate  is  also  available,  but  its  use  is  restricted  due  to  its  hygroscopicity  [272].\nPantothenic acid functions as a coenzyme for acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA), implying its\nimportance in aerobic or oxygen-based energy systems [2]. Acetyl CoA supplementation\nhas not been shown to increase aerobic performance in studies [25,52,202,276].  Yet, one\nstudy found a reduction in the lactic acid buildup, but no benefit in performance was\nconcluded [277].\nPyridoxine (B6)is marketed as a supplement that increases muscular growth, strength,\nand aerobic capacity in the lactic acid and oxygen systems [141].  It might additionally\nhave a relaxing effect, which has been related to increased mental power [24]. Surprisingly,\nresearch showed that pyridoxine did not increase the capacity of aerobic exercise or the\naccumulation of lactic acid in well-nourished athletes [23]. However, when paired with\nvitamins  B1  and  B12,  it  has  been  shown  to  raise  serotonin  levels  and  enhance  motor\nabilities, which are required in sports such as pistol shooting and archery [24]. Moreover,\nvitamin B6, thiamin, and pantothenic acid showed inverse relationships with stress risk\nand anxiety [25]. Another study revealed that after a month of vitamin B6 intake, young\nadult athletes reported feeling less anxiety [25]. Table 2 presents studies that investigated\nthe effect of vitamin B6 intake either as part of a multivitamin supplement or as a sole\nintake on exercise performance. Most of the studies reported a positive impact on exercise\nperformance, particularly in cases of vitamin B6 deficiency.\nCyano-cobalamin (B12)is a coenzyme required for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic\nacid (DNA) and serotonin [176].  In theory, it would enhance muscular mass and blood\noxygen-carrying capacity and lessen anxiety [273]. However, no ergogenic impact has been\ndocumented in well-nourished athletes [242]. Interestingly, it may enhance pistol shooting\nperformance due to the stimulation of serotonin production, which reduces anxiety [2].\nA cross-sectional research work studied 100 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/micronutrients.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine","Author":"Hadeel Ali Ghazzawi, Mariam Ali Hussain, Khadija Majdy Raziq, Khawla Khaled Alsendi, Reem Osama Alaamer, Manar Jaradat, Sondos Alobaidi, Raghad Al Aqili, Khaled Trabelsi and Haitham Jahrami","Subject":"The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to examine the effects of micronutrient intake on athletic performance and (ii) to determine the specific micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that offer the most significant enhancements in terms of athletic performance, with the goal of providing guidance to athletes and coaches in optimizing their nutritional strategies.

It is important to acknowledge that\nvitamin B12 is crucial for proper brain functioning, as it aids in faster information processing\nand enhances concentration levels [21].   This has been demonstrated in patients with\nmild cognitive impairment (MCI) who had low-normal levels of vitamin B12 [262]. This\nis especially important for athletes, as improved brain functioning may help improve\nperformance in many ways, from learning new techniques to continuous focus maintenance\nduring long competitions [24].\nFolic acid (folate)is a coenzyme that aids in the synthesis of DNA and red blood\ncells [278]. An increased red blood cell count enhances oxygen supply to muscles during\nexercise [21,79]. It is thought to be crucial in preventing birth abnormalities and may lower\nhomocysteine levels, which is a risk factor for heart disease [22]. Folic acid supplements did\nnot increase exercise performance among malnourished athletes with folate deficiency [254].\n10. Vitamin C\nVitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid) can be found in many types of food, including\noranges, strawberries, broccoli, and sweet potatoes [15]. Athletes require more vitamin C\nthan the average person since their bodies are working harder and being pushed to the\nlimits [15,279].  Therefore, they need to receive enough of this vital nutrient to perform\nat their best.  Researchers have reported that the intake of vitamin C supplements does\nnot boost physical performance in well-nourished athletes [52]. Nevertheless, athletes are\nrecommended to receive an adequate amount of vitamin C from their balanced diet.\nThe crucial role of vitamin C in neutralizing free radicals has been raised from its\nantioxidative potency [69], thereby improving the immune system [15] and reducing the\nrisk of illnesses such as colds and other viruses [280]. It plays an important role in immunity\nby enhancing the differentiation and proliferation of B and T lymphocytes and increasing\nantibodies levels [25].  Furthermore, vitamin C has been reported to modulate cytokine\nproduction and decrease histamine levels [169,281]. Studies have also shown that vitamin\nC can eliminate fatigue, improve coordination, and increase endurance [15].\nVitamin C has a crucial role to play in wound healing and collagen production [3]. It\nhelps boost energy levels and protects the body from illnesses and injuries [242]. Vitamin C\nworks as a co-factor to produce collagen for the propyl and lysol hydroxyls enzymes, which\nstabilize the structure of collagen [29]. Furthermore, vitamin C also enhances collagen gene\nexpression in fibroblasts [7], contributing to the strength and integrity of joints and muscles,\nwhich is essential for the success of any athlete. This is supported by the fact that vitamin\nC is crucial in protecting against ROS damage, enhancing keratinocyte differentiation, lipid\nsynthesis, fibroblast proliferation, and migration, which has been seen to shorten the time\nof wound healing [28,282].\nHowever, high levels of vitamin C can, in turn, act as a pro-oxidant rather than an an-\ntioxidant [29]. The overconsumption of vitamin C supplement decreases exercise-induced\nadaptation, delays post-exercise recovery, increases lipid peroxidation, and diminishes\nmitochondrial biogenesis [127].  These effects can hinder skeletal muscle adaptation to\nexercise [3].\n11. Minerals\nNumerous physiological and metabolic processes in the human body involve min-\nerals [283].

Some minerals make weightlifting more effective by\nenhancing athletic performance; these are the minerals that degrade faster when used in\nsports endeavors [285] and thus need to be replaced routinely among athletes to sustain\ntheir performance.  Table 1 summarized the recommendation requirements of minerals\nalong with the rich sources and their roles in exercise performance.\n12. Iron\nIron (Fe) is a crucial mineral for physical performance, and its importance cannot be\noverstated [286]. When it comes to peak performance, an adequate intake of iron can make\nall the difference [149]. It helps the body produce red blood cells, which are necessary for\ntransporting oxygen to the muscles [71]. Without enough iron, athletes and other physically\nactive individuals may suffer from fatigue and lethargy as the body struggles to meet the\nincreased demands [71]. A huge part of the pool of plasma iron (almost 80%) is utilized\nby the bone marrow; this is equivalent to a 20–30 mg/day dose to ensure the efficient\nproduction of erythrocyte [31].\nIn  addition  to  red  blood  cells  production,   iron  is  also  important  for  energy\nmetabolism [31].  It is necessary for converting food into energy, and it helps to ensure\nthat the body can use energy efficiently for physical activities [280].  Iron also helps the\nbody in regulating its temperature, making it an essential nutrient for athletes competing\nin warm climates or hot weather [149]. Finally, it is important for other bodily functions,\nsuch as the immune system, growth, and hormone production [284]. When considering\nphysical performance, it is important to ensure that iron intake is adequate and balanced.\nThe human physiological mechanism preserves the maximum iron [29].  Based on the\ntotal compulsory iron depletion that occurs daily and the average of 10% absorption and\nbioavailability, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other national institutes have\nestimated iron-recommended doses depending on several characteristics including gender,\nage, and race. The recommended dietary intake for females is 18 mg, and for males, it is\n8 mg [31].  Poorly planned diets, coupled with inadequate levels of exercise, can lead to\nanemia and other problems associated with low iron levels [286]. This may cause fatigue,\npoor performance, and a decreased ability to perform physical activities [285]. Therefore, it\nis necessary to consume a high-quality variant diet that involves iron-rich sources [284].\nIt is also important to make sure that athletes have enough time to rest and recover\nbetween  workouts.   Iron  helps  to  replenish  energy  stores  and  reduce  fatigue,  so  it  is\nimportant to give the body time to absorb the nutrient [287].  Additionally, certain sup-\nplements may also help in providing additional iron to meet the demands of physical\nperformance [205]. Athletic training can result in alterations including higher vasculariza-\ntion (creation of new blood vessels), elevated hematocrit, and higher erythrocyte awareness\nin the blood, which may lead to an increase in iron needs [122].  A shortage of iron may\nresult from hemorrhages,  gastric blood loss,  and/or urinary tract bleeding,  especially\namong high-intensity sports [121].  Professionals are predicted to have 70% higher iron\nneeds than non-professionals [287].  Iron deficiency anemia can impede progress in an\nathlete’s training by reducing oxygen delivery [283]. Lastly, most research concluded that\niron supplements do not enhance aerobic performance, unless there is a specific depletion\nand/or anemia reported [149].\n13. Calcium\nAthletes must be in peak physical condition to perform at their best and make sure\ntheir diets are balanced, which is an important part of their training regimen [288]. Calcium\n(Ca) is among the many nutrients that athletes need to remain healthy [289]. It not only\nhelps to keep bones and muscles strong, but it has also been linked to improved perfor-\nmance in athletes [32]. However, insufficient Ca consumption and elevated Ca depletion\nmay expose a person to osteoporosis [194]. Athletes should make sure to consume an ade-\nquate amount of Ca each day as part of their balanced diet, which would achieve around\n1500 mg/d [32,188]. The optimal Ca requirement is 1200 mg/day for adolescents and youth,","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/micronutrients.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine","Author":"Hadeel Ali Ghazzawi, Mariam Ali Hussain, Khadija Majdy Raziq, Khawla Khaled Alsendi, Reem Osama Alaamer, Manar Jaradat, Sondos Alobaidi, Raghad Al Aqili, Khaled Trabelsi and Haitham Jahrami","Subject":"The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to examine the effects of micronutrient intake on athletic performance and (ii) to determine the specific micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that offer the most significant enhancements in terms of athletic performance, with the goal of providing guidance to athletes and coaches in optimizing their nutritional strategies.

With the right diet\nand exercise routine, they may capitalize on the benefits that Ca has to offer and maximize\ntheir performance [32,188].\nNumerous studies have indicated that the adequate and consistent consumption of Ca\ncan potentially enhance physical performance in athletes [289], as it plays a crucial role in\nmaintaining muscle strength, which is a key element for exerciseperformance [35,289]. Ad-\nditionally, it may help reduce injuries and improve recovery time [32]. It is also known that\nCa may protect the bones and joints from stress caused by continuous physical activity [32].\nConversely, improving Ca status with 2000 mg of Ca supplementation has been shown to\nreduce the risk of developing a stress fracture [289]. Calcium also helps to convert carbohy-\ndrates and fat into energy, which can contribute to performance improvement [78,288]. It\nalso helps in reducing fatigue and delaying the onset of muscle soreness [290].\nCalcium can be found in many common foods including milk, yogurt, cheese, and dark\nleafy greens. Other sources include tofu, nuts, fish, and fortified cereals [289]. Additionally,\nathletes may consider Ca supplements if they are unable to receive the recommended\ndaily intake from their diet.   It is important to note that the amount of Ca an athlete\nneeds daily may vary depending on their weight and activity level [289]. Skeletal muscles’\nability to contract and relax depends in part on Ca [291]. The importance of it binding to\ntroponin C for the contraction of muscles has the potential to influence performance [33].\nWhile it is true that training leads to higher Ca loss, primarily through perspiration, the\nfoundations of bone mineralization are Ca, vitamin D, and physical activity [292]. However,\nin rare circumstances, especially if the diet is low in its nutrient density, physical activity\nmight endanger bones [65].  Every athlete should place a high priority on developing\nand maintaining optimal bone health, since vigorous physical activity increases the stress\nfractures risk [85,188].\n14. Potassium\nWhen it comes to athletes’ health and performance, one mineral that is essential to\nsuccess is potassium (K) [293]. It is a required nutrient for human health and is necessary\nfor many physiological processes [293].  Adults should not exceed the consumption of\n2000 mgsodium/day (Na) or 5 g of salt and have a minimum dose of 3510 mg potas-\nsium/day, according to new guidelines established by the WHO [14,281]. It has a crucial\nrole in muscle contractions and helps the body regulate fluid balance, blood pressure, and\nthe heart rate [281]. In addition to its role in muscle contractions, it is also involved in nerve\nfunctions and proper electrolyte balance [59], which may be beneficial to athletes who may\nbe sweating during a long practice or game [29]. Furthermore, proper potassium levels can\nhelp prevent injuries and help athletes maintain their energy levels [177,230].\nPotassium is a great source of energy for athletes [293]. It helps to reduce the amount\nof lactic acid stored in the muscles [59], which may lead to fatigue as well as maintain a\nhealthy metabolism [35]. It is also involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates, which helps\nkeep energy levels high during intense physical activity [177]. It is unknown if potassium\nsupplementation reduces the occurrence of muscular cramping in athletes. It should be\nacknowledged that there have been no reports of ergogenic effects [58].\n15. Magnesium\nMagnesium  (Mg)  is  an  essential  mineral  that  is  recognized  for  its  critical  role  in\nathletic performance and overall health [294]. Magnesium helps to improve energy levels,\nreduce  fatigue,  and  even  increase  muscle  performance,  making  it  a  vital  nutrient  for\nathletes [36]. With its numerous benefits, magnesium is being increasingly taken by athletes\nto help them reach peak performance and maintain their physical health [294]. Magnesium\nhelps to improve energy levels by raising the ATP availability, which is best defined as\nthe gold energy stores of cells [283].  Deficiency may cause ATP levels to be depleted,\nresulting in fatigue and overall reduced performance [34].

The mineral is also important for maintaining muscle performance and\nreducing fatigue [296]. It is known to support muscle contraction and relaxation, allowing\nfor better muscle control and improved performance [142]. It also works to reduce lactic\nacid buildup in muscles, which may help reduce pain during exercise and improve recovery\ntime [297].\nMoreover, Mg has numerous other benefits that support physical wellbeing. It helps\nto improve sleep quality, regulate blood sugar, reduce stress, and even support the cardio-\nvascular system [294,297].  By regularly taking Mg, athletes may benefit from improved\nenergy production, reduced fatigue, and improved physical health, allowing them to reach\ntheir maximum performance potential [36]. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\nis 400 to 420 and 310 to 320 mg/day for 14 to over 70 years of age among males and females,\nrespectively [294].\nMagnesium is a versatile mineral that is important for recovery and is found in over\n300 enzymes that are involved in energy metabolism [297]. It is linked to strength training\nand cardiorespiratory processes, showing a reciprocal relationship between exercise and\nMg in the human body [142]. Exercise controls Mg distribution and usage [296]. Training\ntriggers Mg to be transferred to areas where energy is produced [37]. For instance, during\nprolonged activity, serum Mg may be transferred from serum blood to red blood cells\n(RBCs) or muscle to support exercise. On the other hand, short-term exercise may result in\na reduction in the plasma/serum volume and a rise in serum Mg levels [297].\nMagnesium contributes to the metabolism of energy and supports typical muscular\ncontraction and relaxation [283]. In male athletes, serum Mg levels are favorably correlated\nwith muscular performance [36].  Additionally, research suggests a possible connection\nbetween Mg deficit and muscle cramps by demonstrating how it might alter neuromuscular\nfunction [297]. Physically active people might need more magnesium to sustain their peak\nexercise performance than inactive people do [283]. Low Mg levels may cause ineffective\nenergy metabolism and decreased endurance in individuals who are engaged in a weight\ntraining program [294]. Higher Mg consumption is linked to enhanced cardiorespiratory\nfunction and lower oxygen demand during aerobic exercise [34]. Most studies reported\nlittle impact of 500 mg/day Mg on exercise performance in athletes,  unless there is a\ndeficit [37,142,296]. A study of 16 physically active men who were assigned to 300 mg/day\nfor 14 days of Mg supplementation or a control group concluded no direct impact on\nexercise performance while using Mg supplementation [296].\n16. Zinc\nAthletes of all ages and skill levels rely on zinc (Zn) to keep their bodies performing\nat their peak [298]. It is an essential mineral that our bodies need for metabolic functions\nsuch as cell repair, immune system functioning, hormone production, and healthy skin [38].\nUnfortunately, not all athletes receive enough zinc from food intake, which may leave\nathletes at a disadvantage [38]. According to the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey\n(NDNS), current daily intakes are 9.5 mg and 7.6 mg for men and women, respectively [299].\nThe survey has also shown that 6% of men and 7% of women do not receive enough zinc in\ntheir diet, putting them at a greater risk of deficiency [300]. Fortunately, there are many\nbenefits athletes may reap from adding zinc supplements to their routines [300].\nOne notable benefit of zinc supplementation is the improvement in athletic perfor-\nmance [281], as it reduces blood viscosity and enhances oxygen delivery, thereby boosting\naerobic endurance [38,281].  Zinc helps to increase strength and endurance, so athletes\nmay push their bodies to the limit while still receiving the nutrients they need [298].  A\ndouble-blinded cross-over study featuring 16 female athletes was conducted to estimate\nmuscle strength and endurance [38]. The participants consumed 135 mg/day of Zn for 14\ndays and showed remarkably higher dynamic isokinetic strength and angular speed [29].\nAdditionally, Zn may help to reduce inflammation and soreness, which can accelerate\nrecovery time and reduce the risk of injury [59]. Zinc may also help in improving attention","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/micronutrients.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine","Author":"Hadeel Ali Ghazzawi, Mariam Ali Hussain, Khadija Majdy Raziq, Khawla Khaled Alsendi, Reem Osama Alaamer, Manar Jaradat, Sondos Alobaidi, Raghad Al Aqili, Khaled Trabelsi and Haitham Jahrami","Subject":"The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to examine the effects of micronutrient intake on athletic performance and (ii) to determine the specific micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that offer the most significant enhancements in terms of athletic performance, with the goal of providing guidance to athletes and coaches in optimizing their nutritional strategies.

This can assist athletes in staying focused on their tasks and performing at\ntheir best. Zinc is a vital mineral for athletes of all ages and abilities [273]. Including it as a\nsupplement to their regimen may help enhance strength, endurance, and focus while also\nreducing inflammation and supporting the immune system [92].\nIn addition, Zn may help to boost the immune system, making it easier for athletes\nto fight off colds and other illnesses that can stall their progress by increasing neutrophils’\nability to produce ROS after exercise [7]. It has been indicated that Zn oral consumption of\n25 mg/day while exercising can reduce exercise-induced changes in immune function to\nthe minimum [298]. Moreover, Zn may help support healthy vision and keep skin healthy,\nboth of which are important for optimal performance [258].  Zn impacts the formation\nand efficient functioning of the skin and mucous membranes [298]. It helps maintain skin\ncell membranes, and it plays a part in cell mitosis and differentiation; moreover, it has\nan essential role in the survival of keratinocytes [215] and even in protecting skin against\ninduced UV radiation damage [301].  Lastly, taking Zn supplements may help athletes\nmeet their nutritional goals without having to increase their caloric intake, making it an\nideal supplement for those who are trying to stay lean [6]. Despite Zn supplements being\npopular among athletes, there is limited proof regarding athletic performance improvement\nin a period of 1–6 weeks, as shown in the study of Polat, 2011 [302].\nTo detect the actual impact of zinc oral consumption on the hematological parameters,\na  study  included  24  male  kickboxing  athletes,  who  were  separated  to  form  the  three\nfollowing groups: the EZ group, meaning they were exercising and consuming 2.5 mg/kg\nZn supplement daily; the SZ group, who were supplemented without exercising; and the E\ngroup, who were exercising without being supplemented. After the period of 8 weeks, the\nresults showed a significant increase in the erythrocyte count of the EZ group compared\nto the two other groups (p< 0.001).  The hemoglobin and hematocrit levels increased in\nthe EZ group (p< 0.05).  These results revealed that the combination of exercise and Zn\nsupplementation has a beneficial impact on the hematological parameters of athletes, which\nmay result in enhanced performance and increased stamina [303].  Low levels of Zn in\nthe muscles may diminish exercise endurance because it is necessary for the activity of\nenergy metabolism enzymes [304]. Due to the influence of this enzyme on skeletal muscular\nexercise, lactic dehydrogenase (a Zn-containing enzyme) may facilitate the conversion of\nlactic acid to pyruvate [38]. This finding contradicts the commonly misinterpreted results of\nprevious studies [59,303], which demonstrated that lactate accumulation does not directly\ncause fatigue [305].\n17. Selenium\nOne possible approach for athletes to achieve their goals is by including selenium\n(Se)  in  their  diet,  as  this  mineral  can  be  found  in  a  variety  of  foods  [40].   Selenium,\nwhen  consumed  in  proper  amounts,  will  help  to  boost  an  athlete’s  performance,  im-\nprove mental focus, and reduce inflammation, thereby contributing to overall health and\nfitness [40,41,257].\nSelenium can be found in certain plant and animal products,  and it may also be\nartificially added to processed foods [42]. It is advantageous for athletes due to its power-\nful antioxidant characteristics that boost the body’s defenses against cell damage, hence\nincreasing endurance, strength, and overall performance [40].  Additionally, Se may in-\ncrease mental focus, which improves an athlete’s ability to concentrate on tasks and stay\nmotivated, even if the competition gets tougher [41].  It can also help to reduce levels\nof inflammation and support anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which may boost recovery\ntimes and minimize the risk of injuries [95]. Low levels of serum Se are associated with\nhigh serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), the inflammation biomarker [306] It is well\naddressed that Se increases glutathione peroxidase production, which prevents the effect\nof oxidative stress in response to exercise [303]. On the other hand, Se deficiency reduces\nglutathione peroxidase activity indirectly through controlling the Nuclear Factor kappa-\nlight-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) [257,307].

When  consuming\nthe  recommended  amounts,  it  may  increase  the  overall  health  and  performance  of\nathletes [306,307,309]. Induced excessive mitochondrial oxidative stress could be caused\nby Se supplements overdose and may lead to serious health problems [273] marked by\norganelle damage and dysfunction [310]. Hence, it is important to integrate it into a bal-\nanced diet in appropriate doses rather than consuming mega doses [311].  A systematic\nreview of oral Se supplementation of 180μg/day or 240μg/day (selenium methionine) and\n200μg/day (Sodium Selenite) reported a significant drop in lipid hydroperoxide levels and\nan increase in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in plasma, erythrocyte, and muscle [306].

In addition, the study revealed that Se supplementation may\ninhibit Se deficiencies induced by high-volume and -intensity exercise, but it has no impact\non anaerobic and aerobic athletic performance as well as creatine kinase activity, exercise\ntraining-induced adaptations, and testosterone hormone levels [303,306].\n18. Manganese\nAs athletes struggle to achieve their best performance, they often look to improve their\nhealth and performance. One mineral that has been gaining recognition for its potential\nbenefits is manganese (Mn) [312]. Mn is essential for several bodily functions, including\nenergy production, bone formation, and enzyme activity [264]. Early studies have shown\nthat it may help improve various aspects of athlete health and performance, but little is\nknown about the exact benefits of Mn for athletes [205,303].\nManganese plays an important role in energy production, as it is involved in the\nbreaking-down of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats needed for energy production [205].\nIt also helps the body to utilize energy more efficiently, which may result in improved\nendurance during long-term workouts and competitions [304].  Additionally, it aids in\nthe production of important neurotransmitters, which may improve mental focus and\ncoordination during physical activities [304].  Due to its crucial role in bone formation,\nseveral studies reported the relationship between Mn and bone health [43] It helps in the\ndevelopment of strong and healthy bones [43], which is crucial for athletes to prevent injury\nand speed up recovery time. Low serum Mn levels have been reported among osteoporotic\nwomen compared to healthy subjects [312]. Studies have also suggested that Mn helps to\nprotect cells from damage caused by ROS, which is important during periods of strenuous\nexercise [95,304]. It is crucial for scavenging ROS in mitochondrial oxidative stress, as it\ninvolves the Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) component [95].\nIn a clinical trial, it was found that athletes had significantly higher concentrations of\nbasal Mn levels vs. sedentary individuals, as observed through blood and urine measure-\nments [7]. Conversely, sedentary participants exhibited higher urine levels of Mn, which\ncould be attributed to the possibility of iron deficiency in athletes, leading to increased Mn\nabsorption [313]. There is limited evidence regarding Mn and athletic performance; how-\never, athletes should be evaluated periodically for micronutrients deficiencies. Although\nmore research needs to be conducted, the current evidence suggested that Mn may be\nbeneficial for athletes who are looking to optimize their performance and health [205,304].\nAdding Mn to an athlete’s diet could be useful for maximizing their performance [95].\n19.

Unfortunately,\nmany athletes do not meet the RDA requirements for most micronutrients [6,267]. Micronu-\ntrients would logically be impacted by poor macronutrient consumption [25]. It is common\namong many athletes who are not aware about their exercise energy demands and, on the\ncontrary, suffer from being on a negative energy balance [2]. Negative energy balance due\nto increased or decreased calorie intake or a combination of both is a powerful disruptor of\nthe endocrine milieu [123]. Additionally, it was associated with increased fatigue and men-\ntal disorders [14], reduced fertility, poor bone quality, a higher likelihood of sports injuries,\nendothelial dysfunction, a poor lipid profile, gastrointestinal disturbances, inflammatory\nprocesses, psychiatric conditions (such as emotional state changes/irritability), and poor\nathletic performance [93,108,154,314].\nOne common energy deficiency condition among athletes is the female athlete triad,\ncharacterized by disordered eating, negative energy balance, and irregular or absent men-\nstrual cycles [315].  This condition predisposes women to menstrual dysfunction (amen-\norrhea) [316], diminished bone mineral density, and premature osteoporosis [45].  Each\ndefect of the triad represents a significant medical concern, and if occurring together, the\npossibility of health concerns becomes even more serious and can often cause potential\nthreats to life [317]. Medical adverse consequences associated with disordered eating in-\nvolve decreased levels of glycogen in its stores, reduced lean body mass, long-term fatigue,\ndehydration, micronutrient deficiencies, electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, anemia, gas-\ntrointestinal diseases, parotid gland enlargement, reduced bone density, and tooth enamel\nerosion [300]. Osteoporosis can make adolescent female athletes prone to early bone loss\nand the improper formation of bone, resulting in low bone mineral density [318] and an\nelevated risk of stress fractures [319]. Bone mineral density lost because of amenorrhea may\nbe totally or, at least partially, irreversible, even with the resumption of menses, calcium\nsupplementation, and estrogen replacement therapy [256,320].  The dispensable role of\nsupplementary vitamins and minerals is a concern of the Dietitians of Canada and the\nAmerican College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) for ensuring adequate energy requirements\nare met from a varied and balanced diet with supplementations enrichment.  Equally\nimportantly, sports medicine experts may recommend the use of vitamin and mineral\nsupplements in specific conditions such as energy intake restriction, the adoption of a\nplant-based diet, the presence of illness, or recovery from injuries [242,263,301,321,322]. It\nis worth noting that individual needs vary, and a personalized approach is crucial when\nmaking supplement recommendations.\n20. Conclusions\nVitamins and minerals are crucial for an athlete’s health and performance, none more\nso than others. Micronutrients are essential to achieving optimal health and performance.\nThey participate in many metabolic processes in the body, including energy production,\nmuscle growth, and recovery. Athletes need to ensure they consume sufficient quantities of\nmicronutrients to improve their physical activity and performance. A balanced diet that\nincludes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins may help them\nmeet their micronutrient needs. Additionally, they may benefit from taking a multivitamin\nsupplement if they are not meeting their micronutrient requirements or suffer from malab-\nsorption or specific deficiencies in certain vitamins. However, athletes must avoid taking\nmicronutrient supplements without first ensuring there is a deficiency.

However, athletes should only take micronutrient supplements with the consultation of a specialized physician or nutritionist and avoid taking them without confirming a deficiency.","Keywords":"vitamins; minerals; sport; performance","Creator":"LaTeX with hyperref","Producer":"pdfTeX-1.40.21","CreationDate":"D:20230525171728+08'00'","ModDate":"D:20230525112642+02'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":42},"loc":{"pageNumber":40}}}],["12d6aaf2-da8f-422b-90b0-50cbcd1da196",{"pageContent":"Sports2023,11, 10941 of 42\n271.Lucock, M.

Given the strong\ncorrelation between muscle cross-sectional area\nand muscular strength (111), increased muscle\nmass is a primary goal of athletes involved in strength and\npower sports such as football, rugby, and powerlifting.\nMuscle mass also is vital to the sport of bodybuilding, where\ncompetitors are judged on both the quantity and quality of\ntheir muscle development. On a more general level, muscle\nhypertrophy is also pursued by the many recreational lifters\nwho aspire to develop their physiques to the fullest.\nTherefore, the maximization of muscle mass has far reaching\nimplications to a variety of populations associated with sports\nand health.\nIn untrained subjects, muscle hypertrophy is virtually\nnonexistent during the initial stages of resistance training,\nwith the majority of strength gains resulting from neural\nadaptations (124). Within a couple of months of training,\nhowever, hypertrophy begins to become the dominant\nfactor, with the upper extremities shown to hypertrophy\nbefore the lower extremities (124,177). Genetic background,\nage, gender, and other factors have been shown to mediate\nthe hypertrophic response to a training protocol, affecting\nboth the rate and the total amount of gains in lean muscle\nmass (93). Further, it becomes progressively more difficult to\nincrease lean muscle mass as one gains training experience,\nheightening the importance of proper routine design.\nAlthough muscle hypertrophy can be attained through\na wide range of resistance training programs, the principle of\nspecificity dictates that some routines will promote greater\nhypertrophy than others (16). Research is lacking, however,\nas to the best approach for achieving this goal. Bodybuilders\ngenerally train with moderate loads and fairly short rest\nintervals that induce high amounts of metabolic stress.\nPowerlifters, on the other hand, routinely train with high-\nintensity loads and lengthy rest periods between sets.\nAlthough both groups are known to display impressive mus-\ncularity, it is not clear which method is best for maximizing\nhypertrophic gains (149) or whether other training methods\nmay perhaps be superior. Therefore, the purpose of this\npaper is twofold: (a) to extensively review the literature as to\nthe mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy and their application\nto resistance training variables and (b) to draw conclusions\nfrom the research and develop a hypertrophy-specific routine\nfor maximizing muscle growth.\nTYPESOFMUSCLEHYPERTROPHY\nMuscle hypertrophy can be considered distinct and separate\nfrom muscle hyperplasia. During hypertrophy, contractile\nelements enlarge and the extracellular matrix expands to\nsupport growth (187). This is in contrast to hyperplasia,\nwhich results in an increase in the number of fibers within\na muscle. Contractile hypertrophy can occur either by adding\nsarcomeres in series or in parallel.\nThe majority of exercise-induced hypertrophy subsequent\nto traditional resistance training programs results from an\nBRIEF REVIEW\nAddress correspondence to Brad Schoenfeld, brad@workout911.com.\n24(10)/2857–2872\nJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\nÓ2010 National Strength and Conditioning Association\nVOLUME 24 | NUMBER 10 | OCTOBER 2010 |2857\nCopyright © National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCyw\nCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdtwnfKZBYtws= on 05/16/2024","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/muscle_gain.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.3","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"JSC201435 2857..2872","Keywords":"LWW","Creator":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","Producer":"PD4ML 4.0.18","CreationDate":"D:20100929222902+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20240516213027Z00'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"_dflt__1_:modifydate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:metadatadate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:createdate":"2010-09-29T22:29:02+05:30","_dflt__1_:creatortool":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","_dflt_:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)","_dflt__2_:title":"JSC201435 2857..2872"}},"totalPages":16},"loc":{"pageNumber":1}}}],["eb4845e0-a4f0-4661-8c1b-cbe72a705939",{"pageContent":"increase of sarcomeres and myofibrils added in parallel\n(135,179). When skeletal muscle is subjected to an overload\nstimulus, it causes perturbations in myofibers and the related\nextracellular matrix. This sets off a chain of myogenic events\nthat ultimately leads to an increase in the size and amounts\nof the myofibrillar contractile proteins actin and myosin,\nand the total number of sarcomeres in parallel. This, in turn,\naugments the diameter of individual fibers and thereby results\nin an increase in muscle cross-sectional area (182).\nA serial increase in sarcomeres results in a given muscle\nlength corresponding to a shorter sarcomere length (182). In-\nseries hypertrophy has been shown to occur when muscle is\nforced to adapt to a new functional length. This is seen with\nlimbs that are placed in a cast, where immobilization of\na joint at long muscle lengths results in an increased number\nof sarcomeres in series, whereas immobilization at shorter\nlengths causes a reduction (182). There is some evidence that\ncertain types of exercise can affect the number of sarcomeres\nin series. Lynn and Morgan (107) showed that when rats\nclimbed on a treadmill (i.e., incline), they had a lower\nsarcomere count in series than those who descended (i.e.,\ndecline). This suggests that repeated eccentric-only actions\nlead to a greater number of sarcomeres in series, whereas\nexercise consisting solely of concentric contractions results in\na serial decrease in sarcomere length.\nIt is hypothesized that hypertrophy may be augmented\nby an increase in various noncontractile elements and fluid\n(108,205). This has been termed ‘‘sarcoplasmic hypertro-\nphy,’’ and may result in greater muscle bulk without\nconcomitant  increases  in  strength  (154).  Increases  in\nsarcoplasmic hypertrophy are thought to be training specific,\na  belief  perpetuated  by  studies  showing  that  muscle\nhypertrophy is different in bodybuilders than in powerlifters\n(179). Specifically, bodybuilders tend to display a greater\nproliferation of fibrous endomysial connective tissue and\na  greater  glycogen  content  compared  to  powerlifters\n(109,177), presumably because of differences in training\nmethodology. Although sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is often\ndescribed as nonfunctional, it is plausible that chronic\nadaptations associated with its effects on cell swelling may\nmediate subsequent increases in protein synthesis that lead\nto greater contractile growth.\nSome researchers have put forth the possibility that\nincreases in cross-sectional area may be at least partly\nbecause of an increase in fiber number (8). A meta-analysis by\nKelley (84) found that hyperplasia occurs in certain animal\nspecies  under  experimental  conditions  as  a  result  of\nmechanical overload. Increases in muscle fiber number were\ngreatest  among  those  groups  that  used  an  avian  vs.\na mammalian model, and stretch overload yielded larger\nincreases in fiber count than exercise. However, subsequent\nresearch suggests that such observations may be erroneous,\nwith results attributed to a miscounting of the intricate\narrangements of elongating fibers as a greater fiber number\n(135). Evidence that hyperplasia occurs in human subjects is\nlacking and, if it does occur at all, the overall effects on muscle\ncross-sectional area would appear to be minimal (1,108).\nSATELLITECELLSANDMUSCLEHYPERTROPHY\nMuscle is a postmitotic tissue, meaning that it does not\nundergo significant cell replacement throughout life. An\nefficient method for cell repair is therefore required to avoid\napoptosis and maintain skeletal mass. This is carried out\nthrough the dynamic balance between muscle protein\nsynthesis and degradation (69,182). Muscle hypertrophy\noccurs when protein synthesis exceeds protein breakdown.\nHypertrophy is thought to be mediated by the activity\nof satellite cells, which reside between the basal lamina\nand sarcolemma (66,146). These ‘‘myogenic stem cells’’ are\nnormally quiescent but become active when a sufficient\nmechanical stimulus is imposed on skeletal muscle (187).\nOnce aroused, satellite cells proliferate and ultimately fuse to\nexisting cells or among themselves to create new myofibers,\nproviding the precursors needed for repair and subsequent\ngrowth of new muscle tissue (182).\nSatellite cells are thought to facilitate muscle hypertrophy\nin several ways. For one, they donate extra nuclei to muscle\nfibers, increasing the capacity to synthesize new contractile\nproteins (123). Because a muscle’s nuclear-content-to-fiber-\nmass ratio remains constant during hypertrophy, changes\nrequire an external source of mitotically active cells. Satellite\ncells retain mitotic capability and thus serve as the pool of\na myonuclei to support muscle growth (15). This is consistent\nwith the concept of myonuclear domain, which proposes\nthat the myonucleus regulates mRNA production for a finite\nsarcoplasmic volume and any increases in fiber size must be\naccompanied by a proportional increase in myonuclei. Given\nthat muscles are comprised of multiple myonuclear domains,\nhypertrophy could conceivably occur as a result of either\nan increase in the number of domains (via an increase in\nmyonuclear number) or an increase in the size of existing\ndomains. Both are thought to occur in hypertrophy, with\na significant contribution from satellite cells (182).\nMoreover,  satellite  cells  coexpress  various  myogenic\nregulatory factors (including Myf5, MyoD, myogenin, and\nMRF4) that aid in muscle repair, regeneration, and growth\n(27). These regulatory factors bind to sequence specific DNA\nelements present in the muscle gene promoter, with each\nplaying distinct roles in myogenesis (148,155).\nMYOGENICPATHWAYS\nExercise-induced  muscle  hypertrophy  is  facilitated  by\na number of signaling pathways, whereby the effects of\nmechano-stimulation are molecularly transduced to down-\nstream targets that shift muscle protein balance to favor\nsynthesis over degradation. Several primary anabolic signal-\ning pathways have been identified including Akt/mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR), mitogen-activated protein\nkinase (MAPK), and calcium-(Ca\n2+\n) dependent pathways.\nThe following is an overview of each of these pathways.\n2858Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research\nthe\nTM\nMechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy\nCopyright © National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCyw\nCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdtwnfKZBYtws= on 05/16/2024","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/muscle_gain.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.3","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"JSC201435 2857..2872","Keywords":"LWW","Creator":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","Producer":"PD4ML 4.0.18","CreationDate":"D:20100929222902+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20240516213027Z00'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"_dflt__1_:modifydate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:metadatadate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:createdate":"2010-09-29T22:29:02+05:30","_dflt__1_:creatortool":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","_dflt_:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)","_dflt__2_:title":"JSC201435 2857..2872"}},"totalPages":16},"loc":{"pageNumber":2}}}],["cbad65a1-8002-4369-bc50-7e3cbe12bcc0",{"pageContent":"Akt/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Pathway\nThe Akt/mTOR pathway is believed to act as a master\nnetwork  regulating  skeletal  muscle  growth  (18,77,181).\nAlthough the specific molecular mechanisms have not been\nfully elucidated, Akt is considered a molecular upstream\nnodal point that is both an effector of anabolic signaling and\na dominant inhibitor of catabolic signals (126,182). When\nactivated, Akt signals mTOR, which then exerts effects on\nvarious downstream targets that promote hypertrophy in\nmuscle tissue.\nMitogen-Activated Protein-Kinase Pathway\nMitogen-activated protein kinase is considered a master\nregulator of gene expression, redox status, and metabolism\n(88). Specific to exercise-induced skeletal muscle hypertro-\nphy, MAPK has been shown to link cellular stress with an\nadaptive response in myocytes, modulating growth and\ndifferentiation (147). Three distinct MAPK signaling modules\nare associated with exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy:\nextracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK 1/2), p38 MAPK,\nand c-Jun NH\n2\n–terminal kinase (JNK). Of these modules,\nJNK has shown to be the most responsive to mechanical\ntension and muscle damage, and it is particularly sensitive to\neccentric exercise. Exercise-induced activation of JNK has\nbeen linked to a rapid rise in mRNA of transcription factors\nthat modulate cell proliferation and DNA repair (9,10).\nCalcium-Dependent Pathways\nVarious Ca\n2+\n-dependent pathways have been implicated in\nthe regulation of muscle hypertrophy. Calcineurin (Cn), a\nCa\n2+\n-regulated phosphatase, is believed to be a particularly\ncritical regulator in the Ca\n2+\nsignaling cascade. Cn acts down-\nstream in the Ca\n2+\npathway and mediates various hypertro-\nphic effectors such as myocyte enhancing factor 2, GATA\ntranscription factors, and nuclear factor of activated T cells\n(118). Cn-dependent signaling is linked to hypertrophy of all\nfiber types, and its inhibition has been shown to prevent\nmuscle growth even in the presence of muscular overload\n(35,36).\nHORMONESANDCYTOKINES\nHormones and cytokines play an integral role in the hyper-\ntrophic response, serving as upstream regulators of anabolic\nprocesses. Elevated anabolic hormone concentrations in-\ncrease the likelihood of receptor interactions, facilitating\nprotein metabolism and subsequent muscle growth (31).\nMany are also involved in satellite cell proliferation and\ndifferentiation and perhaps facilitate the binding of satellite\ncells to damaged fibers to aid in muscular repair (182,187).\nThe hormonal regulation of hypertrophy is complex, with\nmany hormones and cytokines believed to contribute to the\nresponse. Hepato growth factor, Interleukin-5 (IL-5), In-\nterleukin-6 (IL-6), fibroblast growth factor, and leukemia\ninhibitory factor, all have been shown to promote anabolism\n(162,182,187). Insulin also has been shown to possess\nanabolic properties, with greater effects on attenuating\nproteolysis rather than heightening protein synthesis. Insulin\nalso is believed to induce mitosis and differentiation of\nsatellite cells (187). Given that insulin levels are suppressed\nduring exercise, however, it is not a modifiable aspect of an\nexercise regimen and thus will not be addressed further here.\nVarious types of exercise have been shown to cause acute,\nand in some cases chronic, hormonal alterations that appear\nto play a role in mediating hypertrophic signaling systems\n(119). The 3 most widely studied of these hormones are\ninsulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), testosterone, and growth\nhormone (GH). Whether the acute hormonal response to\nexercise provides a significant anabolic stimulus has been\nquestioned by some researchers (191,194), however with\nthe inherent experimental limitations in these studies and a\nlarger body of  prevailing basic and applied evidence to\nthe contrary, such an overt dismissal of the importance of\nhormonal signaling in the physiological adaptations resulting\nfrom resistance exercise over a training period is without\ncontext and premature.\nInsulin-Like Growth Factor\nInsulin-like growth factor is often referred to as the most\nimportant mammalian anabolic hormone. It is thought to\nprovide the main anabolic response for the body as a whole\nand shows enhanced effects in response to mechanical\nloading (19,63). Structurally, IGF-1 is a peptide hormone, so\nnamed because of its structural similarities to insulin. Insulin-\nlike growth factor receptors are found in activated satellite\ncells, adult myofibers, and Schwann cells (15). During\nexercise, muscles not only produce more systemic IGF-1\nthan the liver but also use more circulating IGF-1 (49).\nAvailability of IGF-1 for muscle is controlled by IGF-1\nbinding proteins (IGFBPs), which either stimulate or inhibit\nthe effects of IGF-1 after binding to a specific IGFBP (182).\nThree distinct IGF-1 isoforms have been identified: the\nsystemic forms IGF-1Ea and IGF-1Eb, and a splice variant, IGF-\n1Ec. Although all 3 isoforms are expressed in muscle tissue, only\nIGF-1Ec appears to be activated by mechanical signals (63,199).\nBecause of its response to mechanical stimulation, IGF-1Ec is\nfamiliarly called mechano growth factor (MGF).\nAlthough the exact mechanisms of IGF-1’s mode of action\nhave not been fully elucidated, it is believed that mechano-\nstimulation causes the IGF-1 gene to be spliced toward MGF,\nwhich in turn ‘‘kick starts’’ muscle hypertrophy. Within a day\nor so, MGF then completely splices toward the systemic\nIGF-1 isoforms (IGF-1Ea and IGF-1Eb) (54,69). Levels of\nIGF-1 then remain elevated in muscle tissue for some time\nthereafter, with myogenic effects seen up to 72 hours\npostexercise (117). Although MGF has been shown to be\nparticularly sensitive to muscle damage, it is not clear\nwhether the isoform is upregulated by membrane damage or\nif membrane damage initiates MGF production (48).\nInsulin-like growth factor has been shown to induce\nhypertrophy in both an autocrine and paracrine manner (34)\nand exerts its effects in multiple ways.

Moreover,\nlocally expressed MGF has been shown to activate satellite\ncells and mediate their proliferation and differentiation\n(69,200). IGF-IEa, on the other hand, is thought to enhance\nfusion of satellite cells with muscle fibers, facilitating the\ndonation of myonuclei and helping to maintain optimal DNA\nto protein ratios in muscle tissue (182).\nInsulin-like growth factor also activates L-type calcium\nchannel gene expression, resulting in an increased intracel-\nlular Ca\n2+\nconcentration (125). This leads to the activation\nof multiple anabolic Ca\n2+\n-dependent pathways, including\ncalcineurin and its numerous downstream signaling targets.\nTestosterone\nTestosterone is a cholesterol-derived hormone that has a\nconsiderable anabolic effect on muscle tissue (33,105). In\naddition to its effects on muscle, testosterone also can interact\nwith receptors on neurons and thereby increase the amount\nof neurotransmitters released, regenerate nerves, and increase\ncell body size.\nThe majority of testosterone is synthesized and secreted by\nthe Leydig cells of the testes via the hypothalamic–pituitary–\ngonadal axis, with small amounts derived from the ovaries and\nadrenals (22). In the blood, the great majority of testosterone\nis bound to either albumin (38%) or steroid hormone binding\nglobulin (60%), with the remaining 2% circulating in an\nunbound state. Although only the unbound form is bi-\nologically active and available for use by tissues, weakly\nbound testosterone can become active by rapidly disassoci-\nating from albumin (105). Unbound testosterone binds to\nandrogen receptors of target tissues, which are located in the\ncell’s cytoplasm. This causes a conformational change that\ntransports the testosterone to the cell nucleus where it\ninteracts directly with chromosomal DNA.\nAlthoughthe effects of testosterone on muscleare seen inthe\nabsence of exercise, its actions are magnified by mechanical\nloading, promoting anabolism both by increasing the protein\nsynthetic rate and inhibiting protein breakdown (22). Testos-\nterone may also contribute to protein accretion indirectly by\nstimulating the release of other anabolic hormones such as\nGH (31). Moreover, it has been shown to promote satellite cell\nreplication and activation, resulting in an increase in the\nnumber of myogenically committed satellite cells (155).\nSuppression of testosterone has been shown to seriously\ncompromise the response to resistance exercise (100).\nResistance training also has been shown to upregulate\nandrogen receptor content in humans (13,80). In rodents,\nmodulation of androgen receptor content appears to take\nplace in a fiber-type specific manner, with increases specific\nto fast-twitch muscles (20). This would seem to enhance the\npotential for testosterone binding at the cellular level, and\nthus facilitate its uptake into target tissues.\nResistance exercise can have a substantial acute effect\non testosterone secretion. Ahtiainen et al. (2) found significant\ncorrelations between training-induced elevations in testosterone\nand muscle cross-sectional area, suggesting that acute, exercise-\ninduced elevations in testosterone may play an important role\nin muscle hypertrophy. However, acute responses are limited in\nwomen and the elderly, mitigating the hypertrophic potential in\nthese populations (61,90,130).\nThe chronic effects of resistance training on bodily\ntestosterone concentrations are not clear at this time.\nAlthough some studies show sustained increases as a result\nof regimented resistance exercise (60,93,163), others show\nlittle to no change (3,142). Further research is needed to\nenhance understanding on this topic.\nGrowth Hormone\nGrowth hormone is a polypeptide hormone considered to\nhave both anabolic and catabolic properties. Specifically, GH\nacts as a repartitioning agent to induce fat metabolism toward\nmobilization of triglycerides, and stimulating cellular uptake\nand incorporation of amino acids into various proteins,\nincluding muscle (187). In the absence of mechanical loading,\nGH preferentially upregulates the mRNA of systemic IGF-1,\nand mediating nonhepatic IGF-1 gene expression in an\nautocrine/paracrine manner (63).\nGrowth hormone is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland\nand released in a pulsatile fashion, with the greatest\nnonexercise secretions occurring during sleep. More than\n100 molecular isoforms of GH have been identified; however,\nmost resistance training studies have focused solely on the\n22-kDa  isoform,  limiting  conclusions.  Recent  research\nsuggests a preferential release of multiple GH isoforms with\nextended half-lives during exercise, allowing for sustained\naction on target tissues (131).\nIn addition to exerting effects on muscle tissue, GH also is\ninvolved in the regulation of immune function, bone model-\ning, and extracellular fluid volume. In total, GH is implicated\nas promoting over 450 actions in 84 cell types (190).\nGrowth hormone levels spike after the performance of\nvarious types of exercise (96). An exercise-induced increase in\nGH has been highly correlated with the magnitude of type I\nand type II muscle fiber hypertrophy (113). It is postulated\nthat a transient GH increase may lead to an enhanced\ninteraction with muscle cell receptors, facilitating fiber\nrecovery and stimulating a hypertrophic response (134).\nGrowth hormone is also thought to be involved in the\ntraining-induced increase of locally expressed IGF-1 (75).\nWhen combined with intense exercise, GH release is\nassociated with marked upregulation of the IGF-1 gene in\nmuscle so that more is spliced toward the MGF isoform (63).\nSome researchers have questioned whether GH does, in\nfact, have a significant hypertrophic effect on muscle tissue\n(143). This view is based on the results of several studies that\nhave failed to find significant increases in muscle mass when\nGH was administered as part of a resistance training protocol\n(101,201–203). However, these protocols did not replicate\nthe large spikes in GH seen postexercise, nor did they take\n2860Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research\nthe\nTM\nMechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy\nCopyright © National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCyw\nCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdtwnfKZBYtws= on 05/16/2024","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/muscle_gain.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.3","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"JSC201435 2857..2872","Keywords":"LWW","Creator":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","Producer":"PD4ML 4.0.18","CreationDate":"D:20100929222902+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20240516213027Z00'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"_dflt__1_:modifydate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:metadatadate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:createdate":"2010-09-29T22:29:02+05:30","_dflt__1_:creatortool":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","_dflt_:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)","_dflt__2_:title":"JSC201435 2857..2872"}},"totalPages":16},"loc":{"pageNumber":4}}}],["29f53e49-8f5f-4f75-9333-68c7bbc9f711",{"pageContent":"into account the time course of GH elevation in conjunction\nwith myotrauma. Thus, it is impossible to draw conclusions\nfrom these studies as to whether an exercise-induced GH\nresponse is associated with skeletal muscle anabolism. Much\nis still unclear about the anabolic actions of GH, and further\nresearch is needed to fully elucidate its role in muscular\ndevelopment.\nCELLSWELLING\nCellular hydration (i.e., cell swelling) serves as a physiological\nregulator of cell function (65). It is known to simulate anabolic\nprocesses, both through increases in protein synthesis and\ndecreases in proteolysis (53,120,165). Although a physiological\nbasis linking cell swelling with an anabolic drive is yet to be\ndetermined, it is conceivable that increased pressure against\nthe membrane is perceived as a threat to cellular integrity,\nwhich in turn causes the cell to initiate a signaling response\nthat ultimately leads to reinforcement of its ultrastructure.\nA hydrated cell has been shown to initiate a process that\ninvolves activation of protein-kinase signaling pathways in\nmuscle, and possibly mediating autocrine effects of growth\nfactors in signaling the anabolicresponse to membrane stretch\n(106). Cell swelling induced membrane stretch may also have\na direct effect on the amino acid transport systems mediated\nthrough an integrin-associatedvolume sensor. Phosphatidyli-\nnositol 3-kinase appears to be an important signaling component\nin modulating glutamine and alpha-(methyl)aminoisobutyric\nacid transport in muscle because of cell swelling (106).\nResistance exercise has been shown to induce alterations of\nintra- and extracellular water balance (156), the extent of\nwhich is dependent upon the type of exercise and intensity\nof training. Cell swelling is maximized by exercise that relies\nheavily on glycolysis, with the resultant lactate accumulation\nacting as the primary contributor to osmotic changes in\nskeletal muscle (41,157). Fast-twitch fibers are particularly\nsensitive to osmotic changes, presumably related to a high\nconcentration of water transport channels called aquaporin-4.\nAquaporin-4 has been shown to be strongly expressed in the\nsarcolemma of mammalian fast-twitch glycolytic and fast-\ntwitch  oxidative-glycolytic  fibers,  facilitating  the  influx\nof fluid into the cell. Given that fast-twitch fibers are most\nresponsive to hypertrophy, it is conceivable that cellular\nhydration  augments  the  hypertrophic  response  during\nresistance training that relies heavily on anaerobic glycolysis.\nExercise regimens that cause an increased glycogen storage\ncapacity also have the potential to augment cell swelling.\nGiven that glycogen attracts three grams of water for every\ngram of glycogen (25), this may reflect an increased capacity\nfor protein synthesis in those who possess greater in-\ntramuscular glycogen stores.\nHYPOXIA\nHypoxia has been shown to contribute to increases in muscle\nhypertrophy, with effects seen even in the absence of exercise.\nTakarada et al. (172) found that 2 daily sessions of vascular\nocclusion  significantly  attenuated  muscular  atrophy  in\na group of patients confined to bed rest. Similar findings\nwere observed by Kubota et al. (62,98), with occlusion\nconferring a protective effect on muscle strength and cross-\nsectional area during a 2-week period of leg immobilization.\nWhen combined with exercise, hypoxia seems to have an\nadditive effect on hypertrophy. This was demonstrated by\nTakarada et al. (173), who divided 24 older women into\n3 subgroups: low-intensity elbow flexion exercise (;50%\n1 repetition maimum [1RM]) with vascular occlusion, low-\nintensity elbow flexion exercise (;50% 1RM) without occlu-\nsion, and high- to medium-intensity elbow flexion exercise\nwithout occlusion (;80% 1RM). After 16 weeks, the group\nthat performed low-intensity training with occlusion showed\na significantly greater cross-sectional area of the elbow flexor\nmuscles as compared to low-intensity exercise without occlu-\nsion. Moreover, the hypertrophic gains realized were similar\nto those experienced by the moderate- to high-intensity group.\nThere are several theories as to the potential hypertrophic\nbenefits of muscle hypoxia. For one, hypoxia has been shown\nto cause an increased lactate accumulation and reduced acute\nlactate clearance rate (173). This may mediate increased cell\nswelling, which has been shown to upregulate protein syn-\nthesis. Moreover, the rise in lactate may mediate elevations in\nanabolic hormones and cytokines. Takarada et al. (172) noted\na 290% increase in GH levels after low-intensity hypoxic\ntraining and an increase in the concentration of the myogenic\ncytokine IL-6, which was sustained for 24 hours postexercise.\nAnother potential mechanism of hypoxic-induced hyper-\ntrophy is its effect on the activity of reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). Reactive oxygen species production has been shown\nto promote growth in both smooth muscle and cardiac\nmuscle (170), and it is theorized to have similar hypertrophic\neffects on skeletal muscle (171). Nitric oxide, an ROS pro-\nduced during exercise, has been shown to mediate the pro-\nliferation of satellite cells, which would presumably lead to\ngreater skeletal muscle growth (81,174). Reactive oxygen\nspecies generated during resistance training also has been\nshown to activate MAPK signaling in skeletal myoblasts (83),\npotentially modulating a hypertrophic response.\nHypoxia also may promote hypertrophic effects from\nreactive hyperemia (i.e., increased blood flow) after ischemic\nexercise (173). Hyperemia within damaged muscle would\nconceivably allow for the delivery of anabolic endocrine\nagents and growth factors to satellite cells, thereby regulating\ntheir proliferation and subsequent fusion into myotubes (187).\nINITIATIONOFEXERCISE-INDUCEDMUSCLE\nHYPERTROPHY\nIt is hypothesized that 3 primary factors are responsible for\ninitiating the hypertrophic response to resistance exercise:\nmechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress\n(38,79,153,185).

More specifically, mech-\nanical overload increases muscle mass while unloading results\nin atrophy (47). This process appears largely controlled by\nprotein synthetic rate during the initiation of translation (11,87).\nIt is believed that tension associated with resistance training\ndisturbs the integrity of skeletal muscle, causing mechano-\nchemically transduced molecular and cellular responses\nin myofibers and satellite cells (182). Upstream signaling is\nthought to occur through a cascade of events that involve\ngrowth factors, cytokines, stretch-activated channels, and\nfocal adhesion complexes (23,48,162). Evidence suggests that\nthe downstream process is regulated via the AKT/mTOR\npathway, either through direct interaction or by modulating\nproduction of phosphatidic acid (72,73). At this point,\nhowever, research has not provided a clear understanding of\nhow these processes are carried out.\nDuring eccentric contractions, passive muscular tension\ndevelops because of lengthening of extramyofibrillar ele-\nments, especially collagen content in extracellular matrix and\ntitin (182). This augments the active tension developed by the\ncontractile elements, enhancing the hypertrophic response.\nBoth the amplitude and duration of excitation coupling is\ndetermined by motor unit (MU) firing frequency, the extent\nof  which  are  believed  to  encode  signals  to  various\ndownstream pathways including Ca\n2+\ncalmodulin phospha-\ntase calcineurin, CaMKII, and CAMKIV, and PKC (26).\nThese pathways help to determine gene expression, coupling\nmuscle excitation with transcription (182).\nPassive tension produces a hypertrophic response that\nis fiber-type specific, with an effect seen in fast-twitch but\nnot slow-twitch fibers. This was demonstrated by Prado et al.\n(139), who found that slow-twitch fibers in rabbits exhibited\nlow passive tension in titin, but the tension was highly\nvariable in fast-twitch fibers.\nAlthough mechanical tension alone can produce muscle\nhypertrophy, it is unlikely to be solely responsible for\nhypertrophic gains associated with exercise (79). In fact,\ncertain resistance training routines employing high degrees of\nmuscle tension have been shown to largely induce neural\nadaptations without resultant hypertrophy (28,188).\nMuscle Damage\nExercise training can result in localized damage to muscle\ntissue which, under certain conditions, is theorized to\ngenerate a hypertrophic response (38,69). Damage can be\nspecific to just a few macromolecules of tissue or result in\nlarge tears in the sarcolemma, basal lamina, and supportive\nconnective tissue, and induces injury to contractile elements\nand the cytoskeleton (187). Because the weakest sarcomeres\nare located at different regions of each myofibril, the\nnonuniform lengthening causes a shearing of myofibrils.\nThis deforms membranes, particularly T-tubules, leading to\na disruption of calcium homeostasis and consequently\ndamage because of tearing of membranes and/or opening\nof stretch-activated channels (4).\nThe response to myotrauma has been likened to the acute\ninflammatory response to infection. Once damage is perceived\nby the body, neutrophils migrate to the area of microtrauma\nand agents are then released by damaged fibers that attract\nmacrophages and lymphocytes. Macrophages remove cellular\ndebris to help maintain the fiber’s ultrastructure and produce\ncytokines that activate myoblasts, macrophages and lympho-\ncytes. This is believed to lead to the release of various growth\nfactors that regulate satellite cell proliferation and differenti-\nation (182,187).\nFurthermore, the area under the myoneural junction\ncontains a high concentration of satellite cells, which have\nbeen shown to mediate muscle growth (69,155). This gives\ncredence to the possibility that nerves impinging on damaged\nfibers might stimulate satellite cell activity, thereby pro-\nmoting hypertrophy (187).\nMetabolic Stress\nNumerous studies support an anabolic role of exercise-\ninduced metabolic stress (145,149,161) and some have\nspeculated that metabolite accumulation may be more\nimportant than high force development in optimizing the\nhypertrophic response to training (153). Although metabolic\nstress does not seem to be an essential component of mus-\ncular growth (40), a large body of evidence shows that it can\nhave a significant hypertrophic effect, either in a primary or\nsecondary manner. This can be noted empirically by exam-\nining the moderate intensity training regimes adopted by\nmany bodybuilders, which are intended to heighten metab-\nolic stress while maintaining significant muscular tension.\nMetabolic stress manifests as a result of exercise that relies\non anaerobic glycolysis for ATP production, which results in\nthe subsequent buildup of metabolites such as lactate,\nhydrogen ion, inorganic phosphate, creatine, and others\n(169,178). Muscle ischemia also has been shown to produce\nsubstantial metabolic stress, and potentially produces an\nadditive hypertrophic effect when combined with glycolytic\ntraining (136,182). The stress-induced mechanisms theorized\nto mediate the hypertophic response include alterations in\nhormonal milieu, cell swelling, free-radical production, and\nincreased activity of growth-oriented transcription factors\n(50,51,171). It also has been hypothesized that a greater acidic\nenvironment promoted by glycolytic training may lead\nto increased fiber degradation and greater stimulation of\nsympathetic nerve activity, thereby mediating an increased\nadaptive hypertrophic response (22).\nTRAININGVARIABLESANDMUSCLEHYPERTROPHY\nConsistent with the principle of specificity, proper manipu-\nlation of training variables is essential for maximizing\nexercise-induced muscle hypertrophy.

Intensity is customarily expressed as a percentage of\n1RM and equates to the number of repetitions that can be\nperformed with a given weight. Repetitions can be classified\ninto 3 basic ranges: low (1–5), moderate (6–12), and high\n(15+). Each of these repetition ranges will involve the use of\ndifferent energy systems and tax the neuromuscular system in\ndifferent ways, impacting the extent of the hypertrophic\nresponse.\nThe use of high repetitions has generally proven to be\ninferior to moderate and lower repetition ranges in eliciting\nincreases in muscle hypertrophy (24,71). In the absence of\nartificially induced ischemia (i.e., occlusion training), a load\nless than approximately 65% of 1RM is not considered suffi-\ncient to promote substantial hypertrophy (115). Although\nsuch high rep training can bring about significant metabolic\nstress, the load is inadequate to recruit and fatigue the highest\nthreshold MUs.\nWhether low reps or moderate reps evoke a greater\nhypertrophic response has been a matter of debate, and both\nproduce significant gains in muscle growth (24). However,\nthere is a prevailing belief that a moderate range of approx-\nimately 6–12 reps optimizes the hypertrophic response\n(86,89,205).\nThe anabolic superiority of moderate repetitions has been\nattributed to factors associated with metabolic stress. Although\nlow repetition sets are carried out almost exclusively by the\nphosphocreatine system, moderate repetition schemes rely\nheavily  on  anaerobic  glycolysis  (144).  This  results  in\na significant buildup of metabolites. Studies of bodybuilding-\nstyle exercise routines performed with multiple sets of 6–12\nreps show significant postexercise declines in ATP, creatine\nphosphate, and glycogen, along with marked increases in\nblood lactate, intramuscular lactate, glucose and glucose-\n6-phosphate (37,178). Buildup of these metabolites has been\nshown to have a significant impact on anabolic processes (96).\nIt is therefore conceivable that there is a maximum threshold\nfor tension-induced hypertrophy, above which metabolic\nfactors become more important than additional increases\nin load.\nResultant to metabolic buildup, moderate repetition range\ntraining has been shown to maximize the acute anabolic\nhormonal response of exercise. Both testosterone and GH are\nacutely elevated to a greater degree from routines employing\nmoderate rep sets as compared to those using lower\nrepetitions (57,90,92,94,114), thereby increasing the potential\nfor downstream cellular interactions that facilitate remodel-\ning of muscle tissue.\nTraining in a moderate repetition range also maximizes\nacute cellular hydration. During moderate rep training, the\nveins taking blood out of working muscles are compressed\nwhile arteries continue to deliver blood into the working\nmuscles, thereby creating an increased concentration of\nintramuscular blood plasma. This causes plasma to seep out of\nthe capillaries and into the interstitial spaces. The buildup\nof fluid in the interstitial spaces causes an extracellular\npressure gradient, which causes a flow of plasma back into the\nmuscle causing the phenomenon commonly referred to as\na ‘‘pump.’’ This is augmented by the accumulation of\nmetabolic byproducts, which function as osmolytes, drawing\nfluid into the cell (157). Whether acute exercise-induced cell\nswelling mediates muscle hypertrophy is not known, but it\nseems plausible given the known role of hydration in\nregulating cell function.\nMoreover, the extra time under tension associated with\na moderate repetition scheme as compared to a lower rep\nscheme  would  theoretically  enhance  the  potential  for\nmicrotrauma and fatigueability across the full spectrum of\nmuscle fibers. This would seem to have greatest applicability\nfor hypertrophy of slow-twitch fibers, which have greater\nendurance capacity than fast-twitch fibers and thus would\nbenefit by increased time under tension. Although slow-\ntwitch fibers are not as responsive to growth as fast-twitch\nfibers, they nevertheless do display hypertrophy when sub-\njected to an overload stimulus. Given that the majority of\nwhole muscles exhibit significant slow-twitch profiles (55,102),\nthis can potentially help to maximize whole muscle girth.\nSome researchers have postulated that muscles containing\na greater percentage of slow-twitch fibers might have the\ngreatest hypertrophic response to a higher repetition range,\nwhereas fast-twitch muscles would respond best to lower\nrepetitions (138,192). Although this concept is intriguing,\na fiber-type prescription with respect to repetition range\nhas not been borne out by research. Moreover, given the\nvariability of fiber-type composition between individuals, it\nwould be difficult to impossible to determine fiber-type ratios\nwithout muscle biopsy, thus making application impractical\nfor the vast majority of people.\nVolume\nA set can be defined as the number of repetitions performed\nconsecutively without rest, whereas exercise volume can be\ndefined as the product of total repetitions, sets, and load\nperformed in a training session. Higher-volume, multiple-set\nprotocols have consistently proven superior over single set\nprotocols with respect to increased muscle hypertrophy\n(97,197).\nIt is not clear whether the hypertrophic superiority of\nhigher-volume workloads is the product of greater total\nmuscle tension, muscle damage, metabolic stress, or some\ncombination of these factors. Higher-volume, body-building-\nstyle programs that generate significant glycolytic activity\nhave been consistently proven to elevate acute testosterone\nVOLUME 24 | NUMBER 10 | OCTOBER 2010 |2863\nJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\nthe\nTM\n|www.nsca-jscr.org\nCopyright © National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCyw\nCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdtwnfKZBYtws= on 05/16/2024","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/muscle_gain.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.3","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"JSC201435 2857..2872","Keywords":"LWW","Creator":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","Producer":"PD4ML 4.0.18","CreationDate":"D:20100929222902+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20240516213027Z00'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"_dflt__1_:modifydate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:metadatadate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:createdate":"2010-09-29T22:29:02+05:30","_dflt__1_:creatortool":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","_dflt_:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)","_dflt__2_:title":"JSC201435 2857..2872"}},"totalPages":16},"loc":{"pageNumber":7}}}],["93b07ca2-877e-4172-b199-faf9df984a00",{"pageContent":"levels to a greater extent than low-volume routines (92,94).\nSchwab et al. (150) showed that testosterone did not significantly\nincrease during squat performance until after completion of\nthe fourth set, indicating a clear benefit of multiple-set routines in\nthis regard.\nHigher-volume programs also have been shown to mediate\nthe acute release of GH, particularly in routines designed\nto heighten metabolic stress (70). A large body of research\nshows multiple-set protocols elicit greater GH responses\nthan single set protocols (29,124). Smilios et al. (158)\ncompared the GH response of a maximum strength (MS)\nroutine consisting of 5 reps at 88% of 1RM, 3 minutes rest\nwith a maximal hypertrophy (MH) routine consisting of 10\nreps at 75% of 1RM, 2 minutes rest in young men. Post-\nexercise GH was measured after 2, 4, and 6 sets. GH levels\nwere significantly greater after the 4-set compared to the\n2-set sessions in MH but not in MS, indicating a superiority\nof higher-volume routines that generate metabolite buildup.\nA split body routine where multiple exercises are per-\nformed for a specific muscle group in a session may help to\nmaximize the hypertrophic response (86). Compared to full\nbody routines, a split routine allows total weekly training\nvolume to be maintained with fewer sets performed per\ntraining session and greater recovery afforded between ses-\nsions (85). This may enable the use of heavier daily training\nloads and thus generate greater muscular tension. Moreover,\nsplit routines can serve to increase muscular metabolic stress\nby prolonging the training stimulus within a given muscle\ngroup, potentially heightening acute anabolic hormonal\nsecretions, cell swelling, and muscle ischemia.\nTo maximize hypertrophy, evidence exists that volume\nshould be progressively increased over a given periodized\ncycle, culminating in a brief period of overreaching. Over-\nreaching can be defined as a planned, short-term increase in\nvolume and/or intensity intended to improve performance.\nImprovements are thought to be obtained by initiating\na ‘‘rebound effect’’ where an initial decrease in anabolic drive\ncauses the body to supercompensate by significantly in-\ncreasing accretion of body proteins (42,189). Training status\nhas been shown to affect the overreaching response, with\nreduced detrimental effects to the endocrine system seen in\nthose with 1-plus years of experience (44). To ensure optimal\nsupercompensation, the period of overreaching should be\nfollowed by a brief taper or cessation from training (99).\nProlonged periods of overreaching, however, can rapidly\nlead to an overtrained state (62). Overtraining has catabolic\neffects on muscle tissue, and is characterized by chronically\ndecreased concentrations of testosterone and luteinizing\nhormone, and increased cortisol levels (43,58,140). The\ncytokine hypothesis of overtraining states that primary cause\nof  overtraining  syndrome  is  repetitive  trauma  to  the\nmusculoskeletal system resulting from high-intensity and\nhigh-volume training (159,160). However, studies seem to\nshow that overtraining is more a result of excessive volume\nthan intensity (43,59). Given that recuperative abilities are\nhighly variable between individuals, it is essential to be\ncognizant of an athlete’s training status and adjust volume\naccordingly to avoid a negative effect on protein accretion.\nFurthermore, the quest to train with a high volume must be\nbalanced with performance decrements arising from lengthy\nexercise sessions. Long workouts tend to be associated with\nreduced intensity of effort, decreased motivation, and alter-\nations in immune response (92). Accordingly, it has been\nproposed that intense workouts should not last longer than\none hour to ensure maximal training capacity throughout the\nsession (205).\nExercise Selection\nIt is a well-accepted fitness tenet that varying exercise\nparameters (i.e., angle of pull, position of extremities, etc.) can\ncause different activation patterns within muscle compart-\nments, and making synergists more active or less active (17).\nThis is particularly important in a hypertrophy-oriented\nprotocol, where promoting uniform growth of muscle tissue\nis essential for maximizing overall muscle girth.\nMuscles can have different attachment sites that provide\ngreater leverage for varying actions. The trapezius, for\nexample, is subdivided so that the upper aspect elevates the\nscapula, the middle aspect abducts the scapula and the lower\nportion depresses the scapula (103). With respect to the\npectoralis major, the sternal head is significantly more active\nthan the clavicular head in the decline bench press (46).\nFurther, the clavicular head of the pectoralis major and long\nhead of the triceps have been shown to be more active in the\nnarrow grip bench press vs. the wide grip variation, with\nanterior deltoid activity increasing in conjunction with\nincreases in the degree of trunk inclination (14).\nRegional differences within various muscles can impact\ntheir response to exercise choice. For example, slow and fast\nMUs are often scattered across muscle, so that a slow-twitch\nfiber can be activated while an adjacent fast-twitch fiber is\ninactive and vice versa (7). Moreover, muscles are sometimes\ndivided into neuromuscular components—distinct regions\nof muscle each of which is innervated by its own nerve\nbranch—suggesting that portions of a muscle can be called\ninto play depending on the activity (7). For example, the\nsartorius, gracilis, biceps femoris, and semitendinosus are all\nsubdivided by one or more fibrous bands or inscriptions, with\neach compartment innervated by separate nerve branches\n(193,198). Further, the gracilis and sartorius are composed of\nrelatively short, in series fibers that terminate intrafascicu-\nlarly, refuting the supposition that muscle fibers always span\nthe entire origin to insertion (67).\nThe effects of muscle partitioning on mechanical activity\nare seen in the biceps brachii, where both the long and short\nheads have architectural compartments that are innervated\nby private branches of the primary neurons (151). Studies\ninvestigating muscle activity of the long head of the biceps\nbrachii show that MUs in the lateral aspect are recruited for\nelbow flexion, MUs in the medial aspect are recruited for\n2864Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research\nthe\nTM\nMechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy\nCopyright © National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCyw\nCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdtwnfKZBYtws= on 05/16/2024","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/muscle_gain.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.3","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"JSC201435 2857..2872","Keywords":"LWW","Creator":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","Producer":"PD4ML 4.0.18","CreationDate":"D:20100929222902+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20240516213027Z00'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"_dflt__1_:modifydate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:metadatadate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:createdate":"2010-09-29T22:29:02+05:30","_dflt__1_:creatortool":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","_dflt_:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)","_dflt__2_:title":"JSC201435 2857..2872"}},"totalPages":16},"loc":{"pageNumber":8}}}],["23444114-ae77-4d7a-9b9e-c2b5502b1fc8",{"pageContent":"supination, and centrally located MUs are recruited for non-\nlinear combinations of flexion and supination (175,176,184).\nFurther, the short head appears to be more active in the latter\npart of an arm curl (i.e., greater elbow flexion), whereas the\nlong head is more active in the early phase (21).\nThese architectural variances of muscle give support for\nthe need to adopt a multiplanar, multiangled approach to\nhypertrophy training using a variety of different exercises.\nMoreover, given the need to fully stimulate all fibers within\na muscle, it would seem that a frequent exercise rotation is\nwarranted to maximize the hypertrophic response.\nThere is evidence to support the inclusion of both\nmultijoint and single-joint exercises in a hypertrophy-specific\nroutine. Multijoint exercises recruit large amounts of muscle\nmass to carry out work. This has an impact on the anabolic\nhormonal response to training. Specifically, the magnitude\nof postexercise hormonal elevations has been shown to be\nrelated to the extent of muscle mass involved, with multijoint\nmovements producing larger increases in both testosterone\nand GH levels compared to single-joint exercises (64,91).\nMoreover, multijoint movements tend to require significant\nstabilization of the entire body, thereby involving numerous\nmuscles that otherwise might not be stimulated in the per-\nformance of single-joint movements. The squat, for example,\ndynamically recruits not only the quadriceps femoris and hip\nextensors but also most of the other lower body muscles\nincluding the hip adductors, hip abductors, and triceps surae\n(132). In addition, significant isometric activity is required by\na wide range of supporting muscles (including the abdomi-\nnals, erector spinae, trapezius, rhomboids, and many others)\nto facilitate postural stabilization of the trunk. In all, it is\nestimated that over 200 muscles are activated during squat\nperformance (167). To achieve a comparable degree of mus-\ncular coverage would necessitate the performance of dozens\nof single-joint movements—a strategy that is both inefficient\nand impractical.\nOn the other hand, single-joint exercises allow for a greater\nfocus on individual muscles compared to multijoint move-\nments. During performance of multijoint movements, certain\nprime movers may take precedence over others, creating\na hypertrophic imbalance between muscles. The use of single-\njoint exercises can selectively target underdeveloped muscles,\nimproving muscular symmetry. Moreover, the unique archi-\ntecture of individual muscles suggests employing single-joint\nmovements can elicit differing neuromuscular activation\npatterns that heighten overall muscular development (7).\nThe use of unstable surfaces in a hypertrophy-oriented\nroutine is generally not supported by research. Resistance\nexercise on an unstable surface requires extensive activation of\nthe core musculature to carry out performance (6,110). This,\nin turn, results in significant decreases in force output to the\nprime muscle movers. Anderson and Behm (5) found that\nforce output was 59.6% lower when performing a chest press\non an unstable surface compared to a stable surface. Similarly,\nMcBride et al. (112) demonstrated significant reductions in\npeak force and rate of force development (by 45.6 and 40.5%,\nrespectively) when performing a squat on an unstable vs.\nstable surface. Such large reductions in force output diminish\ndynamic tension to the target muscles, mitigating the\nhypertrophic response.\nAn exception to the use of unstable surfaces in a hypertro-\nphy-oriented routine involves exercises for the core muscu-\nlature. Sternlicht et al. (164) found that crunches performed\non a stability ball elicited significantly greater muscle activity\nin both the upper and lower rectus abdominus than crunches\nperformed under stable conditions. Similar results were\nshown by Vera-Garcia et al. (186), who displayed significantly\nincreased activity of both the rectus abdominis and the exter-\nnal obliques when performing curl ups on an unstable surface\ncompared to a stable surface. These results suggest a role for\nunstable surface training in developing the abdominals.\nRest Interval\nThe time taken between sets is referred to as the rest interval.\nRest intervals can be classified into 3 broad categories: short\n(30 seconds or less), moderate (60–90 seconds), and long (3\nminutes or more). The use of each of these categories has\ndistinct effects on strength capacity and metabolite buildup,\nthereby impacting the hypertrophic response (195).\nShort rest intervals tend to generate significant metabolic\nstress, thereby heightening anabolic processes associated with\nmetabolite buildup (52). However, limiting rest to 30 seconds\nor less does not allow sufficient time for an athlete to regain\nmuscular strength, significantly impairing muscular perfor-\nmance in subsequent sets (137,141). Thus, the hypertrophic\nbenefits associated with greater metabolic stress are seem-\ningly counterbalanced by a decreased strength capacity,\nmaking short rest intervals suboptimal for maximizing\nhypertrophic gains.\nLong rest intervals afford full recovery of strength between\nsets, facilitating the ability to train with maximum force\ncapacity (121). de Salles et al. (32) displayed that rest intervals\nof 3–5 minutes allowed for greater repetitions over multiple\nsets when training with loads between 50 and 90% of 1RM.\nHowever, although mechanical tension is maximized by long\nrest periods, metabolic stress is compromised (92,94). This\nmay blunt anabolic drive, attenuating a maximal hypertro-\nphic response.\nModerate rest intervals appear to provide a satisfactory\ncompromise between long and short rest periods for\nmaximizing the muscle hypertrophy. Research indicates that\na majority of an athlete’s strength capacity is recovered within\nthe first minute after cessation of a set (168). Moreover,\nconsistently training with shorter rest intervals leads to\nadaptations that ultimately allow a lifter to sustain a signif-\nicantly higher mean percentage of 1RM during training (95).\nThese adaptations include increased capillary and mito-\nchondrial density and an improved capacity to buffer H+ and\nshuttle it out of muscle, thereby minimizing performance\ndecrements.\nVOLUME 24 | NUMBER 10 | OCTOBER 2010 |2865\nJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\nthe\nTM\n|www.nsca-jscr.org\nCopyright © National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCyw\nCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdtwnfKZBYtws= on 05/16/2024","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/muscle_gain.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.3","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"JSC201435 2857..2872","Keywords":"LWW","Creator":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","Producer":"PD4ML 4.0.18","CreationDate":"D:20100929222902+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20240516213027Z00'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"_dflt__1_:modifydate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:metadatadate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:createdate":"2010-09-29T22:29:02+05:30","_dflt__1_:creatortool":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","_dflt_:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)","_dflt__2_:title":"JSC201435 2857..2872"}},"totalPages":16},"loc":{"pageNumber":9}}}],["6ea74f7b-6fcd-4087-99d8-cc9d7156952c",{"pageContent":"Moderate rest intervals also help to enhance the body’s\nanabolic environment to a greater extent than longer rest\nintervals. For one, moderate rest induces greater hypoxia,\nheightening the potential for increased muscular growth\n(182). Moderate rest also is associated with a greater metab-\nolic buildup, mediating a large spike in anabolic hormonal\nconcentrations after exercise (94). However, there is some\nevidence that this hormonal advantage is not sustained over\ntime. Buresh et al. (22) compared the anabolic hormonal\nresponse to routines with rest intervals of 1 vs. 2.5 minutes.\nAlthough the shorter rest intervals had a significantly greater\nimpact on elevating GH levels in the early stages of the\nprotocol, the difference in hormonal response was not\nsignificant between routines by end of the fifth week and\nwas nonexistent by week 10. This suggests a postadaptive\nresponse by the muscles to reduced rest intervals, lending\nsupport to the need for periodization in a hypertrophy-\noriented resistance training program.\nMuscular Failure\nMuscular failure can be defined as the point during a set when\nmuscles can no longer produce necessary force to concen-\ntrically lift a given load. Although the merits of training\nto failure are still a matter of debate, it is commonly believed\nthat training to muscular failure is necessary to maximize\nthe hypertrophic response (196). Several theories have been\nproposed in support of this contention.\nFor one, training to failure is hypothesized to activate\na greater number of MUs (196). When a lifter becomes\nfatigued, a progressively greater number of MUs are recruited\nto continue activity, providing an additional stimulus for\nhypertrophy (145). In this way, failure may provide increased\nstimulation to the highest threshold MUs when moderate\nrepetition ranges are employed.\nTraining to failure also may enhance exercise-induced\nmetabolic stress, thereby potentiating a hypertrophic re-\nsponse. Continuing to train under conditions of anaerobic\nglycolysis heightens the buildup of metabolites, which in turn\nenhances the anabolic hormonal milieu. Linnamo et al. (104)\ndisplayed that performing sets at 10RM to failure caused\na significantly greater postexercise elevation in GH secretion\ncompared to the same load not performed to failure.\nAlthough training to failure does appear to confer hyper-\ntrophic benefits, there is evidence that it also increases the\npotential for overtraining and psychological burnout (43).\nIzquierdo et al. (76) found that training to failure caused\nreductions in resting IGF-1 concentrations and a blunting of\nresting testosterone levels over a 16-week protocol, suggest-\ning that subjects may have been overtrained. Thus, although\nit seems prudent to include sets performed to failure in\na hypertrophy-oriented program, its use should be perio-\ndized and/or limited to avoid an overtrained state.\nRepetition Speed\nThe speed with which a lifter performs repetitions can impact\nthe hypertrophic response. Despite limitations both in the\nquantity of research and aspects of study design, some\nconclusions can be drawn on the topic.\nWith respect to concentric repetitions, there is some\nevidence that faster repetitions are beneficial for hypertrophy.\nNogueira et al. (133) found that performing concentric\nactions at 1-second cadence instead of three seconds had\ngreater impact on both upper and lower limb muscle thick-\nness in elderly men. This may be attributed to an increased\nrecruitment and corresponding fatigue of high-threshold\nMUs. Other studies, however, suggest that training at moder-\nate speeds has greater effects on hypertrophy (56), perhaps\nthrough a heightened metabolic demand (12). Maintaining\ncontinuous muscle tension at moderate repetition speeds also\nhas been shown to enhance muscle ischemia and hypoxia,\nthereby augmenting the hypertrophic response (174). Train-\ning at very slow velocities (i.e., superslow training) has\ngenerally been shown to be suboptimal for the development\nof strength and hypertrophy (82,129), and therefore should\nnot be employed when the goal is to maximize muscle growth.\nFrom a hypertrophy standpoint, speed of movement may\nhave greater importance on the eccentric component of a\nrepetition. Although concentric and isometric contractions\nhave been shown to produce a hypertrophic response, a\nmajority of studies seem to show that eccentric actions have\nthe greatest effect on muscle development. Specifically,\nlengthening exercise is associated with a more rapid rise in\nprotein synthesis (122) and greater increases in IGF-1 mRNA\nexpression (152) compared to shortening exercise. Moreover,\nisotonic and isokinetic training that does not include\neccentric contractions result in less hypertrophy than those\nthat include lengthening contractions (39,68,74).\nThe hypertrophic superiority of eccentric exercise is largely\nattributed to a greater muscular tension under load. It is\ntheorized that this is because of a reversal of the size principle\nof recruitment, which results in fast-twitch fibers being\nselectively recruited (152,173). This was demonstrated by\nNardone and Schieppati (128), who showed derecruitment of\nthe slow-twitch soleus muscle and a corresponding increase\nin activity of the gastroc during eccentric plantar flexion\ncontractions. There is also evidence that eccentric contrac-\ntions result in additional recruitment of previously inactive\nMUs (116,127).\nAs a result of the excessive stress on a small number of\nactive fibers, eccentric exercise also is associated with greater\nmuscle damage when compared to concentric and isometric\ncontractions (116). This manifests as Z-line streaming, which\ncurrent  research  suggests  is  indicative  of  myofibrillar\nremodeling  (30,204).  It  has  been  shown  that  MyoD\nmRNA expression is specifically upregulated by eccentric\ncontractions (78).\nShepstone et al. (152) found that fast (3.66 rads\u0001s\n21\n) eccen-\ntric repetitions resulted in significantly greater hypertrophy\nof type II fibers compared to slow (0.35 rad\u0001s\n21\n) repetitions.\nThis is consistent with the lengthening portion of the force–\nvelocity curve, which shows greater muscle forces are\n2866Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research\nthe\nTM\nMechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy\nCopyright © National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCyw\nCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdtwnfKZBYtws= on 05/16/2024","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/muscle_gain.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.3","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"JSC201435 2857..2872","Keywords":"LWW","Creator":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","Producer":"PD4ML 4.0.18","CreationDate":"D:20100929222902+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20240516213027Z00'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"_dflt__1_:modifydate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:metadatadate":"2010-09-29T22:57:55+05:30","_dflt__1_:createdate":"2010-09-29T22:29:02+05:30","_dflt__1_:creatortool":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W","_dflt_:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)","_dflt__2_:title":"JSC201435 2857..2872"}},"totalPages":16},"loc":{"pageNumber":10}}}],["fdf597ed-ed2f-415e-99c5-0b588f9c4be7",{"pageContent":"generated at higher velocities. However, findings of this study\nare  limited  because  subjects  trained  on  an  isokinetic\ndynamometer, which provides a resistive force against the\nagonist muscle and is not gravity dependent. Traditional\ndynamic constant resistance exercise (i.e., free weights, cable\npulleys, etc.) does not confer such an advantage. Rather,\neccentric contractions are aided by the pull of gravitational\nforce, requiring the lifter to resist gravity to sustain muscular\ntension. Thus, a slower speed of movement is necessary to\nmaximize the training response (45).\nPRACTICALAPPLICATIONS\nCurrent research suggests that maximum gains in muscle\nhypertrophy are achieved by training regimens that produce\nsignificant metabolic stress while maintaining a moderate\ndegree of muscle tension. A hypertrophy-oriented program\nshould employ a repetition range of 6–12 reps per set with rest\nintervals of 60–90 seconds between sets. Exercises should\nbe varied in a multiplanar, multiangled fashion to ensure\nmaximal stimulation of all muscle fibers. Multiple sets should\nbe employed in the context of a split training routine to\nheighten the anabolic milieu. At least some of the sets should\nbe carried out to the point of concentric muscular failure,\nperhaps alternating microcycles of sets to failure with those\nnot performed to failure to minimize the potential for\novertraining. Concentric repetitions should be performed at\nfast to moderate speeds (1–3 seconds) while eccentric\nrepetitions should be performed at slightly slower speeds\n(2–4 seconds). Training should be periodized so that the\nhypertrophy phase culminates in a brief period of higher-\nvolume overreaching followed by a taper to allow for optimal\nsupercompensation of muscle tissue.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe author would like to thank Dr. William Kraemer, Dr.\nJames Eldridge, and Dr. Sue Mottinger for their assistance and\nguidance in this research review.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Introduction\nA large amount of misleading news has circulated on social media, blogs, TV and magazines about\nhuman nutrition. A specific food or nutrient is often presented as a cure for one or more pathologies,\nranging from diabetes mellitus to cancer or Alzheimer's disease [1]. A great amount of information\nwithout scientific reliability relative to the treatment of overweightness/obesity is available, a topic in\nwhich myths and presumptions are very common [2]. Comprehension of the individual energy balance\nis particularly complex, owing to physiological compensation to changes in energy intake and/or\nexpenditure [3]. Social media, the Internet, TV and magazines frequently propose direct-to-consumer\n“information” about food, dietary schemes or supplements which increase the energy expenditure\nand/or burn fats or, otherwise, reduce the energy expenditure and lead to fat accumulation. However,\nmost of these advertisements contain mis- or dis-information. Some examples include: “drink a lot\nand consume fat-burning foods” (e.g., pineapple, ginger, onion, avocado, asparagus, celery, chili,\nbroccoli, green tea, garlic, etc.) and “avoid the foods that make you fat” (e.g., pasta, bread and foods\ncontaining gluten, oil, dairy products, etc.), in order to lose weight [4].  All these suggestions are\ngenerally incorrect: there are no foods with negative calories and focusing on one or a few foods or\nnutrients does not work, as a multifaceted and individualized program with careful follow-up over\nNutrients2020,12, 1161; doi:10.3390/nu12041161www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/nutrients_and_energy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"A Critical Review on the Role of Food and Nutrition in the Energy Balance","Author":"Simona Bo, Maurizio Fadda, Debora Fedele, Marianna Pellegrini, Ezio Ghigo and Nicoletta Pellegrini","Subject":"The mass media has increasingly frequently suggested to the general population that specific foods or nutritional schemes are able to affect both human metabolism and energy expenditure, thus facilitating weight loss.

This kind of mis-/dis-information is particularly concerning, owing\nto its influence on the general population, and such wrong beliefs have been found to be hard to correct,\nespecially in people with lower cognitive ability [6].\nThe aim of the present paper is to critically review the available evidence about the roles of nutrients,\nfood, and dietary regimens on energy intake and energy expenditure, taking into consideration all the\nconditions potentially impacting on the final energy balance, including the gut microbiota. In particular,\nwe analyzed the following topics:\n(i)The energy balance in humans;\n(ii)Energy intake from food;\n(iii)Energy expenditure due to food intake;\n-the role of nutrients;\n-the role of foods;\n-the role of diet plans;\n(iv)The impact of the gut microbiota on the human energy balance.\n2. Methods\nThe following databases were queried: PubMed (National Library of Medicine), the Cochrane\nLibrary, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied\nHealth Literature (CINAHL). The search strategy was performed by using database-specific subject\nheadings and keywords (i.e., energy, energy expenditure, energy balance, energy intake, caloric intake,\ndiet-induced thermogenesis, thermogenesis, plus the specific nutrients/foods/diets or gut microbiota).\nNo restrictions were placed.  Hand-searching the references of the studies and reviews of the field\nwas performed to augment the search strategy.  To search for toxicity information (of single foods),\nthe  following  terms  were  used:   toxicity,  adverse  events,  adverse  effects,  side  effects,  reactivity\nand interactions.\nFew papers were available about many topics; therefore, all the research articles were considered\nwith the following scale of priority: systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs), human observational studies, case series, animal studies and in vitro studies.\n3. The Energy Balance in Humans\nIn humans, energy intake (EI) and energy expenditure (EE) are in a complex balance, resulting from\nthe difference between EI and EE, aimed at maintaining a relatively constant level of energy stores over\ntime in accordance with the principle of energy conservation [3]. When EI is reduced, a corresponding\nreduction in EE occurs (and vice versa), in order to minimize perturbations to energy homeostasis [7].\nEnergy intake is derived from dietary macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates and lipids) and alcohol.\nThe absorption of calories depends both on food and individual characteristics [3]. A high degree of\noverfeeding was associated with a greater fractional decrease in stool energy loss in lean but not in obese\nindividuals, thus indicating that the degree of overnutrition relative to individual weight-maintaining\nenergy needs may play a role in the determination of the efficiency of nutrient absorption [8]. Daily total\nenergy expenditure (TEE) can be split into different components: resting energy expenditure (REE),\nwhich is the energy required to support body’s basic metabolic activities; activity-induced energy\nexpenditure (AEE), the energy cost of physical activity and exercise; diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT),\nthe energy spent to process the ingested food (about 10%-15% of TEE); and the energy necessary for\nbody thermoregulation. REE can be 3%–10% higher than basal energy expenditure (BEE), which is\nthe energy required to maintain vital body functions [9–11]. REE is mostly determined by body size\nand composition and is positively correlated with body weight and fat-free mass.  AEE is the most\nvariable component of TEE depending on an individual’s lifestyle [12,13].

A major site of AT\nis the brown adipose tissue (BAT), where non-shivering thermogenesis occurs with the uncoupling of\nmitochondrial substrate oxidation from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and the release of\nfatty acid oxidation energy as heat [17,18].  BAT is activated not only by cold exposure, but also by\ncertain food ingredients, thus contributing to DIT [19,20]. The same signals activating BAT also induce\nthe expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in white adipose tissue (WAT) cells (the “beige” cells),\na phenomenon known as browning [21].\nEither energy restriction or overfeeding induce adaptive changes in the energy balance, with AT,\nrespectively directed towards energy sparing or vice versa. Reducing habitual energy intake by about\n10% reduces TEE by 10%–15%, mainly due to reduced REE; furthermore, AT can explain about 50% of\nthe less-than-expected weight loss in patients with obesity [16,22].\n4. Energy Intake from Food\nThe actual energy content of some foods may differ from the energy,  which is theoretically\ncalculated, due to differences in macronutrient digestibility and food structure [23,24]. One of the best\nexamples of this discrepancy is represented by nuts.  Herein, we shortly describe the energy of this\nparadigmatic food.\nTree nuts are energy-dense foods, due to their high content of lipids (ranging between 40–75 g\nper 100 g) [25]. However, the inclusion of nuts as part of a healthy diet does not affect body weight,\nas reported by observational and experimental studies, even though nuts may benefit weight-loss\ndiets [24].  Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this discrepancy, including appetite\ncontrol, increased DIT (as discussed below), and discrepancies in available metabolizable energy\n(ME, i.e., the amount of the food available energy to the human organism) [24]. To calculate the food\nME, each energy-contributing food component is multiplied by its Atwater factor [23].  However,\nrecent evidence has demonstrated that the Atwater factors do not provide accurate ME values for\nseveral nuts in healthy volunteers [26–29].  Indeed, based on the measurements on urine and feces,\nME values were found to be 25%, 20%, 16% and 5% less than those calculated for almonds, walnuts,\ncashews and pistachios, respectively. The reason for this discrepancy is partly due to the structure of\nnuts, which limits the accessibility of digestive enzymes. In oilseeds, such as nuts, lipids are stored in\noil bodies which are covered by a thin layer of phospholipids and proteins and encapsulated in cell\nwalls [30], whose components (e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose, peptic substances and lignin) are mainly\nindigestible by human digestive enzymes [23].  After nut mastication, large particles representing\nclusters of intact cells remain, which provide protection against disintegration and a physical barrier\nfor enzyme hydrolysis and microbiota metabolism [31]. These clusters of cells, with intracellular lipids\nencapsulated within the cell walls, were still intact after having passed through the human intestine,\nthus reducing the intake of energy. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that when almonds were\nchewed 10 times, a higher number of larger particles was obtained than when they were chewed\n25 or 40 times [32].  These large particles retain more energy and lipids (which are then lost in the\nstool) than smaller ones (43.7%, 32.7% and 30.8% of the lipid load was lost in the stool after 10, 25\nand 40 chews, respectively).  On the other hand, other processes (such as roasting) make almonds\nmore brittle and crunchy, with the subsequent production of smaller particles after mastication [33]\nand the induction of swelling of the cell walls with increased porosity and destruction of oil bodies,\nfavoring the access of digestive enzymes [30].  These changes slightly increased the measured ME","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/nutrients_and_energy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"A Critical Review on the Role of Food and Nutrition in the Energy Balance","Author":"Simona Bo, Maurizio Fadda, Debora Fedele, Marianna Pellegrini, Ezio Ghigo and Nicoletta Pellegrini","Subject":"The mass media has increasingly frequently suggested to the general population that specific foods or nutritional schemes are able to affect both human metabolism and energy expenditure, thus facilitating weight loss.

In almond butter, where the cellular structure is fully destroyed, there is a\nfull release of energy, with no discrepancy between the measured ME and the predicted energy content.\nSimilarly, fecal fat content was significantly higher when 70 g of whole peanuts were consumed in\nhealthy adults, compared to other forms of peanuts (i.e., oil, butter and flour) [35].\nThe effect of structure on the actual energy content of foods has been shown mainly for nuts,\nbut the same effect may be extended to other seeds, legumes and some cereals.  This lower actual\nenergy content may have an impact on the overall energy intake when a diet is rich in unprocessed\nfoods where the food structure is retained [23].\n5. Energy Expenditure Due to Food Intake\n5.1. The Role of Nutrients\nFood intake stimulates energy expenditure; this is a well-known phenomenon, called DIT or\nthe thermic effect of food.  DIT accounts for ~10%–15% of TEE, which is a meaningful amount of\nthe human body daily energy expenditure [36] and which can be measured by indirect calorimetry\nthrough the assessment of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production [37]. However, this\nmethod of measurement based on respiratory exchange has been recently blamed for overestimating\nDIT, as it is based on the assumption that all metabolic processes of the organism consume oxygen and\nproduce carbon dioxide, which is not always true [38]. Both insulin resistance and, to a lesser extent,\nabdominal adiposity, have an impact on DIT by reducing the thermic effect of a meal [39].  In fact,\ninsulin, by increasing glucose oxidation and inhibiting lipid oxidation, regulates the cellular substrate\nflow and utilization, which is therefore impaired in the presence of abnormal insulin sensitivity [40].\nAt present, there is great interest in the possibility of modulating DIT in order to increase the\nbody's energy expenditure and promote weight loss. First of all, DIT has been proven to be influenced\nby meal timing, with DIT being higher in the morning and reduced in the evening [41].  Increased\nnocturnal insulin-resistance and heightened ghrelin levels, slower evening gastric emptying with\nincreased carbohydrate absorption, and increased morning sympathetic activity have been proposed\nas possible explanations [42]. In addition to meal timing, DIT is influenced by the caloric content of\na meal and increases in a direct proportion to the energy intake [14,43].  Finally, the macronutrient\ncomposition of food seems to meaningfully affect post-prandial energy expenditure, even if the data\nin the literature are controversial. Commonly, proteins have been considered to induce an increased\nenergy expenditure which, combined with a higher satiating effect, could determine a higher weight\nloss [39,44]. On the other hand, carbohydrates and lipids determine a lower DIT than proteins (protein>\ncarbohydrates>lipids) [45,46]. Meals with protein percentages ranging from 11%–30% of the total\ncalories proportionally increase DIT until the value of 30%, where a plateau is reached and a subsequent\nincrease in the protein intake does not increase further the thermic effect of the meal [47]. The protein\nsource should be taken into account, as well: casein, soy or whey proteins are metabolized differently,\nwhich may explain the variability in the speed and extent of DIT increase. In particular, whey proteins\nlead to higher DIT than caseins, while contrasting results have been obtained in the comparison of\nwhey and soya proteins [48]. Regarding the quality of other nutrients, medium-chain lipids seem to\nheighten DIT more than long-chain triglycerides [49,50] and unsaturated fats more than saturated,\nprobably due to up-regulation of proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-αexpression [51].  Finally,\nunrefined, fiber-rich carbohydrates determine an increased energy expenditure, especially if contained\nin low-processed foods [39].\nOverall, very few data are available about this topic and the clinical significance of any single\nnutrient or single meal is unclear in a weight-loss strategy.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/nutrients_and_energy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"A Critical Review on the Role of Food and Nutrition in the Energy Balance","Author":"Simona Bo, Maurizio Fadda, Debora Fedele, Marianna Pellegrini, Ezio Ghigo and Nicoletta Pellegrini","Subject":"The mass media has increasingly frequently suggested to the general population that specific foods or nutritional schemes are able to affect both human metabolism and energy expenditure, thus facilitating weight loss.

The Role of Foods\nAn increasing number of foods are supposed to increase human energy expenditure [52]. The list\nis long and is gradually getting longer (Supplementary Table S1). Herein, we examined those for which\nscientific studies were available (Figure 1).\nNutrients 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5  of  28  \n \n \nFigure 1. Supposed mechanisms of action of food impacting on energy balance. \n5.2.1. Green Coffee \nAvailable Evidence \nAlmost  the  whole  world’s  coffee  consumption  derives  from  the  beans  of  two  coffee  plants—\nCoffea canephora and Coffea arabica—which contain many bioactive compounds, such as caffeine (1,3,7-\ntrimethylxanthine) and chlorogenic acid [53]. Green (unroasted) coffee and roasted coffee contain the \nsame amount of caffeine (1.2%–2.2%) but a different percentage of chlorogenic acids (6.5%–10% vs \n2.7%–3.1%, respectively) [54]. Caffeine increases thermogenesis and energy expenditure by several \nmechanisms  [55,56].  In  humans,  the  thermic  effect  lasts  about  150  min  after  a  single-dose  caffeine  \ningestion [56] and one RCT reported a stronger metabolic impact among habitual low consumers of \ncaffeine, thus suggesting the possibility of a long-term insensitivity to the effects of caffeine after high \nand prolonged exposure [57]. In human trials, an increase in energy expenditure has been reported, \nvarying  from  6%  (after  50  mg  caffeine  intake)  [58]  to  7%  (after  200  mg  caffeine  consumption)  [57].  \nChlorogenic acid has been reported to have beneficial effects against obesity and other dysmetabolic \ndisorders,  as  well  as  playing  a  favorable  role  in  energetic  metabolism  in  both  human  and  animal  \nstudies [59,60]. In a pilot study, the consumption of 1 cup of green coffee (containing 6 mg caffeine \nper kg of lean body mass, about 215–280 mg) determined an increase of REE by 6.4% at 30 min and \n2.2% at 180 min, with a positive correlation between the chlorogenic acid assumed and the REE values \nat 30 min [61]. \nMolecular Mechanisms of Action \nIn cultured adipocytes, caffeine has been shown to enhance BAT function and thermogenesis by \nup-regulating  UCP1  and  BAT-selective  regulatory  genes  including  PPAR-γ,  PPAR-γ  coactivator  \n(PGC)-1α  and  PR  domain  containing  16  (PRDM16)  [55].  PGC-1α  also  induces  mitochondrial  \nbiogenesis and stimulates fatty-acid oxidation and oxygen consumption through the co-activation of \nPPAR-γ  [55].  Caffeine  induces  PGC1α  and  UCP1  indirectly  as  well,  by  antagonizing  the  transient  \nreceptor potential vanilloid (TRPV)-4, a negative regulator of PGC-1α in the TRPV receptor family \nand  a  modulator  of  beige/brown  adipocyte  thermogenesis  [55].  Adipose  tissue  browning  is  \nadditionally stimulated through the expression of other specific genes (CD137, LHX8, P2RX5, CITED1 \nand COX8b) [55].

Chlorogenic acid principally\nup-regulates the AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) with increased fatty acid oxidation and ATP\nproduction [63].\nToxicity and Reactivity\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)\nand Health Canada, the consumption of up to 400 mg caffeine can be considered safe in healthy\nadults, without overt, adverse cardiovascular, behavioral, reproductive, bone and developmental\neffects [64–66]. No reactivity with drugs, supplements or food has been reported for green coffee.\n5.2.2. Green Tea (Camellia sinensis)\nAvailable Evidence\nThe leaves of the plantCamellia sinensisgive the three most popular types of tea, green (unfermented),\nblack (fully fermented) and oolong (semifermented) [67].  The main components of green tea are\npolyphenols, in particular flavon-3-ols, also known as catechins, mostly epigallocatechin-3-gallate\n(EGCG) [68]. Caffeine is naturally contained in green tea as well, in a variable amount, according to\nthe brewing period and the tea and water rate [68]. The fermentation process lowers the content of\npolyphenols and increases caffeine in tea; green tea contains two times more catechins, but 2–3 times\nless caffeine than black tea [68,69].  Indeed, most of the studies available on the effects of tea on the\nenergy balance are related to green tea. Manyin vitroand animal studies have documented enhanced\nthermogenesis, heightened energy expenditure and fat oxidation after green tea consumption [68,70,71].\nOther beneficial effects are a reduction in fat mass due to the interruption of lipid emulsification,\nthe inhibition of gastrointestinal digestive enzymes activity, improvements in the gut microbiota and\nreduction in adipocyte differentiation and food intake [69,71,72]. Both human observational studies\nand trials have confirmed increased energy expenditure after the acute administration of green tea,\nbut the long-term effects are not currently proven [69,73–76]. It is noteworthy that in most of the trials,\nthe volunteers were provided with high doses of green tea catechins, equivalent to 3–4 cups of brewed\ngreen tea a day [72], which are usually consumed only by a few population groups.\nMolecular Mechanisms of Action\nCatechins and caffeine (see the previous paragraph) affect energy expenditure differently. Catechins\ninhibit the catechol-O-methyl transferase enzyme (COMT) in almost all the tissues, which, in turn,\ninhibits the degradation of norepinephrine and produces protractedβ-adrenergic stimulation. Hence,\nthe SNS activity is increased along with energy expenditure and fat oxidation [68,72,73].In vivo\nandin vitro, EGCG has been shown to affect energy expenditure by the activation of AMPK, which\npromotes fatty acid oxidation and ATP production [69,72].  EGCG has also been reported to inhibit\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, up-regulate the gene expressions of UCPs in BAT and\ndecrease ATP levels, which activates AMPK [69,72,74].In vitro, fermented green tea induced the\nup-regulation of fatty acid oxidation-related genes and increased energy expenditure by inducing\nserotonin secretion [70].","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/nutrients_and_energy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"A Critical Review on the Role of Food and Nutrition in the Energy Balance","Author":"Simona Bo, Maurizio Fadda, Debora Fedele, Marianna Pellegrini, Ezio Ghigo and Nicoletta Pellegrini","Subject":"The mass media has increasingly frequently suggested to the general population that specific foods or nutritional schemes are able to affect both human metabolism and energy expenditure, thus facilitating weight loss.

Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as\nnausea/vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal bloating and dyspepsia have been reported after the\nintake of high doses of beverages or extracts (corresponding to 5–6 L of beverage/day) [76]. The intake\nof 10–29 mg/kg/day of green tea-based dietary supplements has resulted in liver toxicity due to\noxidative stress and cytotoxic damage [67]. The caffeine content in green tea is low but, depending on\nself-sensitiveness to methylxanthines and doses, symptoms such as nervousness, restlessness, tremors,\npalpitations, sleep disorders, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, epigastric pain and tachycardia have also\nbeen reported [67]. In adults an intake of ~300 mg EGCG/day in solid bolus dose and ~700 mg for tea\npreparations are considered safe [77]. The vitamin K contained in green tea leaves can antagonize the\neffect of anticoagulants [67].\n5.2.3. Cocoa and Dark Chocolate\nAvailable Evidence\nCocoa, the main constituent of dark chocolate derives from theTheobroma cacaotree. Dark chocolate\nis considered a functional food, due to its content of fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, fiber, several\nmethylxanthine  alkaloids  (4%  of  the  dry  weight),  mainly  caffeine  and  theobromine  [78,79]  and\npolyphenols (12%–18% of dry weight); in particular, flavan-3-ols, (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin and\nB-type procyanidins [80–82].  Cocoa has been reported to reduce fatty acid synthesis and transport\nsystems, enhanceβ-cell function, down-regulate insulin receptor kinase activity, improve peripheral\ninsulin sensitivity, inhibit digestive enzymes and increase thermogenesis in liver and WAT both in\nanimals and humans [83–86].  A meta-analysis of human RCTs reported that cocoa/dark chocolate\nsupplementation do not affect anthropometric measures in adults;  however, a subgroup analysis\nindicated that≥30 g dark chocolate per day for at least 4 weeks had favorable effects on weight and\nbody mass index (BMI) [84]. Studies in mice have reported that procyanidins of cocoa liquor (the pure\ncocoa mass derived from cocoa beans), in addition to thermogenic effects, have a role in the prevention\nof postprandial hyperglycemia by increasing glucagon-like peptide-1 activity, phosphorylation of the\nAMPKαand glucose transporter type-4 translocation in skeletal muscle and BAT [87].\nMolecular Mechanisms of Action\nCultured WAT cells of cocoa-fed rats have shown the upregulation of the gene expression of\nUCP2, a homolog of UCP1 implicated in non-shivering thermogenesis [83]. Procyanidins affect energy\nexpenditure by inducing the gene and protein expression of UCPs (UCP1, UCP2 and UCP3), AMPKα\nand PGC-1αin adipose, liver and muscle tissues [88]. Once activated, AMPK leads to the inhibition of\nenergy-consuming biosynthetic pathways, such as fatty acid and sterol synthesis and the activation of\nATP-producing catabolic pathways, such as fatty acid oxidation [89]. PGC-1αincreases mitochondrial\nbiogenesis and the expression of UCPs, promoting fatty acid oxidation as well [88].  Furthermore,\nthe methylxanthines contained in dark chocolate act as adenosine receptor blockersin vivo[90],\naffecting energy expenditure by stimulating basal and noradrenaline-stimulated lipolysis in rat fat\ncells [91]. Xanthine derivatives induce secretion of catecholamines, which bind to adipose cells and\nincrease thermogenesis by increasing the expression of thermogenic genes and releasing free-fatty\nacids which, in turn, enhances UCPs [92]. Studies in humans are needed to confirm these mechanisms.\nToxicity and Reactivity\nDepending on the percentage of dry cocoa, chocolate may contain trace heavy metals–principally\ncadmium and lead–resulting from the contamination of the soil or during manufacturing processes [93].\nEuropean Legislation has set the levels to 1 mg/kg for cadmium and 0.3 mg/kg for lead as the maximum\ntolerable amount in cocoa powder [94].","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/nutrients_and_energy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"A Critical Review on the Role of Food and Nutrition in the Energy Balance","Author":"Simona Bo, Maurizio Fadda, Debora Fedele, Marianna Pellegrini, Ezio Ghigo and Nicoletta Pellegrini","Subject":"The mass media has increasingly frequently suggested to the general population that specific foods or nutritional schemes are able to affect both human metabolism and energy expenditure, thus facilitating weight loss.

Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis)\nAvailable Evidence\nThe infusion (mate) derived from the dried leaves of Yerba mate is widely consumed throughout\nSouth America as well as in many other countries.  Its numerous beneficial effects are likely due to\nthe content of several bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, alkaloids, soaps, triterpenoids,\nflavonoids and chlorogenic acid [95,96]. In one placebo-controlled study, an infusion containing 1.5 g\nmate dry extract increased REE by almost 5% and resulted in a 5% reduction of the respiratory quotient\nin non-obese women and men, probably through increased lipid oxidation capacity [97]. In humans,\npharmacological doses of Yerba mate extracts acutely induced a significant increase in the exercise\nenergy expenditure due to the preferential use of fatty acids as an energy substrate [98]. Chronically,\nthese extracts determined an increase in REE, thermogenesis in WAT and a reduction in the WAT\nsynthesis of fatty acids in mice, leading to weight and fat loss and lower circulating leptin levels [99].\nMolecular Mechanisms of Action\nChlorogenic acid, as already reported for green coffee, increases fatty acid oxidation by upregulation\nof AMPK [63] and inhibits adipogenesis by down-regulation of the expression of specific genes, such as\nCreb-1andC/EBPa[100]. The increased thermogenic effects after supplementation with Yerba mate\nextracts seem to be due to increased mitochondrial genesis and expression of UCPs, resulting in\ngreater efficiency in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and heat dissipation in mice fed with high-fat\ndiet [101].\nToxicity and Reactivity\nThe metabolic effects of Yerba mate have been obtained by using supplements with high doses\nof the active compounds, thus not well representing the effect of the natural food for which human\ndata are still lacking. Toxicological investigations in rats have reported a good tolerability of single\n(up to 2 mg/kg dose) and chronic administration of Yerba mate extracts, which seem to be safe for\nconsumption at dosages up to 300 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats [102,103].\n5.2.5. Bitter Orange (Citrus aurantium)\nAvailable Evidence\nCitrus aurantium, better known as bitter orange, is an evergreen plant whose fruits have been used\nfor many centuries both as a food in Southern Europe and as a supplement in traditional medicine\nin China and South America [104,105].  These fruits contain alkaloids -particularly synephrine and\noctopamine—and other compounds, such as flavonoids -in particular hesperidin, naringin, limonene\nand tangaretin—with potential beneficial effects on metabolism and health [106,107]. A few human\nstudies have demonstrated both an acute thermogenic effect with a statistically significant increase in\nREE, DIT and blood catecholamines levels, as well as weight loss and appetite suppression after the\ningestion of bitter orange extracts [104,107–110]. However, long-term data are lacking, as well as data\nabout the effects of the consumption of the fruit by itself, as the available studies have employed dry\nand purified extracts from the orange peel, containing a high dose (~26 mg) of p-synephrine.\nMolecular Mechanisms of Action\nSynephrine and octopamine,  are contemporaryα- andβ-adrenergic agonists which display\nsympathomimetic effects by contributing to oxidative metabolism, lipolysis promotion andβ3- and\nα-adrenergic  receptor  stimulation  [106].    The  anti-adipogenic  effects  ofp-synephrine  in  3T3-L1\npreadipocytes  are  due  to  the  regulation  of  the  Akt  signaling  pathway  and  the  suppression  of\nadipogenesis-related proteins [111].

The dietary exposure occurring through ingestion of the citrus fruits is\nmuch lower, with the median total daily intake of synephrine being up to 6.7 mg/day, and the safety\nissues are less evident [109,113].\n5.2.6. Ginger\nAvailable Evidence\nGinger (Zingiber officinale) is a plant from the Zingiberaceae family, native to South Eastern Asia,\nwhich is widely used for food, flavoring and as a medicine in China and India historically [114]. A few\nsmall cross-over human trials have studied the effects of ginger on energy expenditure [115,116],\nwith contrasting results, differently from animal [117–122] orin vitrostudies [123], which showed\nimproved energy expenditure, lower weight gain, increased browning of WAT and promotion of\nmitochondrial biogenesis. The contrasting human data, showing either an increased DIT [87] or no\nthermogenic effects [116], do not allow us to obtain definitive conclusions.\nMolecular Mechanisms of Action\nGinger enhances thermogenesis, increased mitochondrial biogenesis, enhanced BAT function and\nactivated WAT browning in animals through the activation of the sirtuin-1 (SIRT1)/AMPK/PGC-1α\npathways  [118,121,122].    The  mRNA  expression  of  Sterol  regulatory  element-binding  protein  1\n(SREBP-1c) in the liver and leptin in adipose tissues were downregulated, while those of adiponectin,\nhepatic  carnitine  palmitoyltransferase1  (CPT-1),  acyl-coA  oxidase  (ACO),  Glucose  transporter  2\n(GLUT-2) and pyruvate kinase (PK) were upregulated after ginger treatment in rats, thus supporting an\neffect of this compound at the transcriptional level of energy metabolizing proteins [119]. An increase\nin cellular fatty acid catabolism via the activation of the PPARδpathway has been shown in mice\ntreated with ginger extracts [120].\nToxicity and Reactivity\nApart from characteristic burning sensation felt upon the consumption of ginger [115], no adverse\neffects or toxicity has been reported in the human studies.

Curcuma Longa\nAvailable Evidence\nTurmeric (Curcuma longa) is an herbaceous plant of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) that has been\nused both as a flavoring and a stimulating agent [125]. Curcumin, also known as diferuloylmethane,\nis a natural flavonoid component of turmeric, whose antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial,\nanticancer,  insulin-sensitizing  and  hypoglycemic  properties  have  been  demonstrated  in  many\nstudies [126–128]. One animal [129] and onein vitro[130] study showed that curcumin promotes the\nbrowning of WAT, while one observational human study [131] has reported that the supplementation of\nan extract ofCurcumareduced the urinary excretion of niacin metabolites and medium- and short-chain\nacylcarnitines; thus suggesting the potential induction of mitochondrialβ-oxidation of fatty acids for\nenergy production. Therefore, the evidence relative to a thermogenic role of curcumin is still scarce.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/nutrients_and_energy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"A Critical Review on the Role of Food and Nutrition in the Energy Balance","Author":"Simona Bo, Maurizio Fadda, Debora Fedele, Marianna Pellegrini, Ezio Ghigo and Nicoletta Pellegrini","Subject":"The mass media has increasingly frequently suggested to the general population that specific foods or nutritional schemes are able to affect both human metabolism and energy expenditure, thus facilitating weight loss.

Overall,  human  studies  have  reported  mild  adverse  effects  after  curcumin\nsupplementation, with gastrointestinal upsets being most common [134]. The long-term consumption\nof  high  doses  of  curcumin  may  be  dangerous  and  case  reports  of  acute  liver  injury  have  been\ndescribed [133]. Owing to its inhibitory effect on cytochromes P450, turmeric can potentially interact\nwith many drugs, such as anticoagulants, antibiotics, cardiovascular drugs, anticancer drugs and\nantidepressants and interactions with clopidogrel, warfarin and etoricoxib have been reported [134,135].\n5.2.8. Cinnamon\nAvailable Evidence\nCinnamaldehyde is a compound found in cinnamon responsible for its particular flavor, which may\nimprove metabolism owing to its reported hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering effects [136]. Two small\nrandomized human clinical trials in healthy subjects showed that the acute ingestion of extracts\nof cinnamon (cinnamaldehyde [137] or cinnamyl isobutyrate, respectively [138]) increased energy\nexpenditure (evaluated by indirect calorimetry) by ~3.6 kcal over 90 min from ingestion [137] or\nreduced short-term energy intake by 4.6% [138], when compared to placebo. These changes are too\nsmall to be clinically relevant.  Animal studies have demonstrated that extracts of cinnamon elicit\nthermogenesis responses [139], reduced visceral adiposity, attenuated hyperphagia and normalized\nenergy efficiency [140] and attenuated obesity through the modulation of genes implicated in the lipid\nmetabolism pathways [141]. Currently, chronic studies conducted with the cinnamon amount usually\nconsumed in an everyday diet are lacking.\nMolecular Mechanisms of Action\nIn  rats,  cinnamon-linked  increased  rate  of  cold  adaptive  thermogenesis  was  due  to  the\nelevation in norepinephrine, blood levels of free fatty acid levels and increased expression of UCP1\nin  BAT  [142].    Experimental  studies  have  reported  the  ability  of  cinnamaldehyde  in  activating\nphospho-AMPK in adipose tissue [140], enhancing thermogenic and metabolic responses in human\nsubcutaneous fat cells through a cAMP dependent protein kinase/p38 mitogen-activated protein\nkinase (p38 MAPK)-dependent pathway (involved in the transcription of thermogenic genes) [143]\nand inducing browning in mice subcutaneous adipocytes by increased expressions of UCP1 and\nother brown adipocyte markers and involvement of theβ3-adrenoreceptor activity [144].  Finally,\ncinnamaldehyde  has  been  shown  to  activate  the  transient  receptor  potential  ankyrin  1  (TRPA1),\nan ion channel located at the cellular surface, acting as a mechanical and chemical stress sensor, which\nis involved in adrenalin secretion [145].\nToxicity and Reactivity\nCinnamon is obtained from different tree species of the genusCinnamomum: Chinese cinnamon\n(Cinnamomum cassiaorCinnamomum aromaticum), coming from the East and containing high level of\ncoumarin, with potential harmful effects [146]; and Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicumor","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/nutrients_and_energy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"A Critical Review on the Role of Food and Nutrition in the Energy Balance","Author":"Simona Bo, Maurizio Fadda, Debora Fedele, Marianna Pellegrini, Ezio Ghigo and Nicoletta Pellegrini","Subject":"The mass media has increasingly frequently suggested to the general population that specific foods or nutritional schemes are able to affect both human metabolism and energy expenditure, thus facilitating weight loss.

Hepatotoxicity, effects of coumarin on coagulation and potential interference with drugs\nand mild adverse events have been reported for Chinese cinnamon, while, the consumption of Ceylon\ncinnamon seems safe [147–149].\n5.2.9. Chili Pepper (Capsicum Species)\nAvailable Evidence\nChili peppers are common food flavoring, which are also used as a traditional medicine in some\ncultures [150,151]. Chilis contain pungent capsaicinoids (capsaicin and dihydro-capsaicin), the major\nbioactive compounds responsible for the hot taste sensation, non-pungent capsaicin analogs, named\ncapsinoids (e.g., capsiate, dihydro-capsiate and nordihydro-capsiate); and antioxidants, vitamins and\ncarotenoids [150]. Studies in humans investigating a wide range of chili doses have shown that the\nweight-loss properties of chili are due to enhanced energy expenditure andthermogenesis [152,153].\nConflicting  results  have  been  found  on  the  properties  of  capsaicin  and  capsiate  in  decreasing\nthe  respiratory  quotient  by  enhancing  fat  oxidation,  due  to  the  different  designs  of  the  studies,\nthe body composition and BMI of the subjects included and the habitual consumption of chili in their\ndiet [152–154].Interestingly, the consumption of 2.56 mg of capsaicin (1.03 g of dried red chili pepper)\nper meal was able to mitigate the unfavorable negative energy balance effect of decrease in DIT and\nREE induced by a 25% caloric restriction in humans [155].  However, the doses required to impact\nmetabolism is high and out of the tolerated range for most people [137].\nMolecular Mechanisms of Action\nIn mice, dietary capsaicin activated thermogenesis in WAT by up-regulating the expression of\nSIRT1 and PGC-1α, both of which increase the expression of UCP1 and bone morphogenetic protein-8b,\nresulting in energy dissipation by thermogenesis, increased EE and metabolic activity [156]. Both in\nmice and humans, capsaicin and capsinoids enhance energy expenditure by triggering BAT through\nmultiple mechanisms, such as the stimulation of non-shivering thermogenesis by binding to TRPV1,\nstimulation of the SNS and catecholamine secretion from the adrenal gland [19,137,152–154,156,157].\nToxicity and Reactivity\nIn   humans,   one  milligram   of  capsaicin   has  neither   adverse  effects   nor  affects   energy\nexpenditure  [137].   Side  effects  with  higher  doses  of  capsaicin,  even  when  provided  in  capsule\nform (up to 135 mg/day) include low palatability, gastric distress, dyspepsia, anal burning, bowel\nirregularities and diarrhea [153].  Capsiate is more tolerable due to its non-pungent characteristics\nderiving from rapid hydrolysis in the oral cavity, with reduced accessibility to nociceptors [153,154].\n5.2.10. Garcinia cambogia\nAvailable Evidence\nGarcinia cambogiais  an  herbal  product  derived  from  the  fruit  of  the  Malabar  tamarind  tree\n(also calledGarcinia gummi-gutta) native to India, Nepal and Sri Lanka [158].  The fruit rind is used\neither as food preservative,  flavoring agent,  food-bulking agent or traditional medicine in many\nAsian countries [159].Garciniacontains xanthones, benzophenones, amino acids and organic acids, of\nwhich hydroxy-citric acid (HCA) accounts for 10%–30% of the weight ofGarciniafruit and 20%–60% of\nthe extract [158].\nStudies with different duration of administration and doses ofGarcinia cambogiaor its extract,\nwere performed both in animals and humans with conflicting results. Favorable effects ofGarcinia cambogia\non glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as on appetite reduction, have been reported [159–161].","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/nutrients_and_energy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"A Critical Review on the Role of Food and Nutrition in the Energy Balance","Author":"Simona Bo, Maurizio Fadda, Debora Fedele, Marianna Pellegrini, Ezio Ghigo and Nicoletta Pellegrini","Subject":"The mass media has increasingly frequently suggested to the general population that specific foods or nutritional schemes are able to affect both human metabolism and energy expenditure, thus facilitating weight loss.

A recent\nmeta-analysis of human trials failed to find a significant weight-loss effect of supplementation with\nGarcinia cambogia[165].\nMolecular Mechanisms of Action\nIn animal studies, supplementation with HCA induced energy expenditure acceleration by the\nactivation of the adiponectin AMPK signaling pathway [166] or through the regulation of thyroid\nhormone levels [167]. HCA inhibits serotonin uptake leading to satiety and reduced food intake and\ndown-regulates ATP-citrate lyase, increasing fat oxidation and decreasingde novolipogenesis [159–161].\nToxicity and Reactivity\nSupplements containing a standardized dose (e.g., 300–500 mg) ofGarcinia cambogia-derived\nHCA, consumed up to three times daily, are considered safe [160]. In one human trial, HCA has been\nsupplemented with doses up to 5600 mg/day without adverse effects [168].

Liver toxicity has been associated\nwith both cholestatic and hepatocellular patterns of injury.\n5.2.11. Guarana (Paullinia cupana)\nAvailable Evidence\nGuarana is a plant native to the Amazon basin, which is largely used by beverage industries [174].\nGuarana seeds contain the highest percentage (2%–8%) of caffeine, compared to any other plant, a high\nconcentration of polyphenols (particularly proanthocyanidins) and small quantities of other stimulant\npurine alkaloids, such as theobromine and theophylline [174,175]. Two human RCTs reported increased\nenergy expenditure [176] and short-term weight and fat loss [177] after Guarana extract administration.\nIn one animal study, Guarana seed powder supplementation prevented weight gain, insulin resistance\nand adipokine dysregulation induced by a Western diet [178]. However, conclusive results regarding\nGuarana supplementation on weight management are still lacking.\nMolecular Mechanisms of Action\nGuarana exerts an anti-adipogenic activity by down-regulating the expression of pro-adipogenic\ngenes,  up-regulating  the  expression  of  anti-adipogenic  genes  and  increasingβ-catenin  nuclear\ntranslocation, which may contribute to adipogenesis inhibition [179]. Guarana induced BAT expansion,\nmitochondrial biogenesis, UCP1 overexpression, AMPK activation and minor changes in gut microbiota\nin rats [178]. Metabolic effects after Guarana supplementation are mainly due to its high caffeine content.\nToxicity and Reactivity\nThe European Medication Agency (EMA) recommends a maximum intake of 2250 mg/day of\nGuarana extract, due to its high percentage of caffeine, which is considered safe up to a dose of\n400 mg/day [64–66].  Supplements containing guarana, together with multiple ingredients—above\nall, high doses of caffeine—have determined agitation, anxiety, insomnia, aggressivity, decreased\nblood bicarbonate and tachycardia up to cardiorespiratory arrest [66,180].  In rats, pharmacological\ninteractions have been reported after administration of guarana supplements, either with central\nnervous system stimulants or lamotrigine and amiodarone, leading to exacerbation of seizures and\nrisk of arrythmias [66].","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/nutrients_and_energy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"A Critical Review on the Role of Food and Nutrition in the Energy Balance","Author":"Simona Bo, Maurizio Fadda, Debora Fedele, Marianna Pellegrini, Ezio Ghigo and Nicoletta Pellegrini","Subject":"The mass media has increasingly frequently suggested to the general population that specific foods or nutritional schemes are able to affect both human metabolism and energy expenditure, thus facilitating weight loss.

Brassicaceae\nAvailable Evidence\nBroccoli  is  a  vegetable  of  theBrassicaceae(orCruciferae)  family,  which  contain  sulfur-based\ncompounds named glucosinolates [181].  These compounds are hydrolyzed to biologically active\nisothiocyanates (ITC) by the action of myrosinase, a vegetable enzyme present in the human gut\nmicrobiota [182,183].  Glucoraphanin, the predominant glucosinolate in broccoli, releases the ITC\nsulforaphane (SFN) [184].  A 100-g serving of fresh broccoli can release 37–75 mg of SFN, but a\ntherapeutic dose of SFN may not be achieved by a regular diet, as transportation, storage conditions,\npreparations and cooking, may decrease the vegetable content of SFN [182].In vitroand animal studies\nhave reported a beneficial effect of SFN on lipid metabolism and thermogenesis [185–188], as well as\non gut microbiota [189]. However, extrapolating these results to humans is difficult because studies\nare still lacking.\nMolecular Mechanisms of Action\nIn vitrostudies have shown that SFN can induce apoptosis in adipocytes [185], inhibit adipocyte\ndifferentiation and promote lipolysis in adipocytes [186].  Both glucoraphanin and SFN exert\nthermogenic effects.  SFN increased both mitochondrial biogenesis and function by up-regulating\nnuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/SIRT1/PGC-1αsignaling [187], as well as\nenhancing UCP1 expression through the activation of the Nrf2; thus promoting browning of WAT [188].\nToxicity and Reactivity\nBrassicaceae  are  considered  a  goitrogenic  food  due  to  the  ability  of  the  goitrin,  a  molecule\nderived from myrosinase hydrolysis of the glucosinolates progoitrin, to inhibit iodine utilization by the\nthyroid [190]. It is worth noting that the effects of overactivation of the Nrf2-related metabolic pathways\nare controversial, as the worsening of insulin resistance, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism, have\nbeen reported in mice [191].\n5.2.13. Nuts\nNut-rich diets have been proved to provide positive effects, both on cardiovascular health (owing to\ntheir content of mono- and polyunsaturated fats, flavonoids and vitamins) and on body weight, BMI or\nwaist circumference [24,192]. At present, the role of nuts in the regulation of energy balance has not\nbeen extensively studied; however, favorable effects have been reported by a couple of RCTs [51,193].\nIn particular, a 28% increase in DIT 5 h after a meal rich in walnuts and a ~100 kcal higher BEE after\n2 months of a nut-rich diet (independent of weight change) have been observed [193].  The role of\npeanuts is even more uncertain as, in a small RCT, the consumption of high-oleic peanuts increased\nDIT more than conventional peanuts, but similarly to controls consuming biscuits [194].\n5.2.14. Apple Cider Vinegar\nApple cider vinegar is a rich source of polyphenols and acetic acid [195]. A systematic review and\nmetanalysis of human trials failed to reach conclusive results on short and long-term blood glucose\ncontrol after the administration of a wide range of dosages of apple cider vinegar [196]. At present,\nstudies about the effects of apple cider vinegar on human energy expenditure are lacking. In Wistar\nrats subjected to a high-fat diet, the supplementation of apple cider vinegar (7 mL/kg/day) for 30 days\nreduced BMI, abdominal circumference and improved satiety [197].In vitro, acetic acid upregulates\nthe expression of genes for fatty acid oxidation enzymes and thermogenic proteins (e.g., ACO, CPT-1,\nand UCP2 throughα2-AMPK/PPARα-mediated pathway [198]. The lack of human studies on the role\nof apple cider vinegar on energy balance makes it impossible to draw conclusions about the potential\neffects of this food.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/nutrients_and_energy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"A Critical Review on the Role of Food and Nutrition in the Energy Balance","Author":"Simona Bo, Maurizio Fadda, Debora Fedele, Marianna Pellegrini, Ezio Ghigo and Nicoletta Pellegrini","Subject":"The mass media has increasingly frequently suggested to the general population that specific foods or nutritional schemes are able to affect both human metabolism and energy expenditure, thus facilitating weight loss.

Spirulina\nSpirulina refers to a large number of photosynthetic eubacterial species belonging to the phylum\nCyanobacteria (Arthrospira platensisand A.maxima) [158].  These microscopic blue-green algae are\na source of high-quality proteins, and contain nearly all essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals,\nfiber and bioactive compounds [199].  A metanalysis of five human trials (278 subjects) found that\nthe chronic administration of spirulina at variable doses (from one to 4.5 g/day) significantly reduced\nbody weight, body fat percentage and waist circumference [200]. Interestingly, the weight loss was not\ndose-dependent and was higher in patients with obesity rather than in those with overweight [201].\nMany beneficial effects, both on glucose and lipid metabolism and oxidant status, have been described in\nhuman studies [200–202]. However, no data about the potential role of spirulina on energy expenditure\nare available; therefore, at present, no compelling evidence on this topic is available.\n5.2.16. Foods without Scientific Evidence to Date\nA long list of foods that have been proposed as “fat-burning” or “slimming” agents have not\nbeen the subject of scientific studies supporting these supposed benefits. Among these are pineapple,\nbitter pumpkin (Momordica charantia), mangosteen,Griffonia simplicifolia,Rhodiola rosea,Hoodia gordonii,\nFucus vesciculosus,Cissus quadrangularis,Irvingia gabonensis,yohimbine,Caralluma fimbriata,Coleus forskohlii\nand avocado (Persea americana).  These foods do have other potential beneficial properties for human\nhealth but, to date, their effectiveness in inducing weight loss is far from proven.\n5.3. The Role of Diet Plans\nA few human trials have compared the individual energy expenditure under different dietary\nregimens. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 32 controlled-feeding studies with 563 participants\nfound  no  effects  on  TEE  of  low-carb  versus  low-fat  diets  with  equivalent  protein  content  [203].\nA few RCTs found a significantly lower TEE decrease with low-carb diets when compared either\nto high-carb [204] or low-fat [205] diets.  However, the pooled weighted mean difference in energy\nexpenditure reported in the metanalysis was negligible (26 kcal/day) and favoring low-fat diets [203].\nMore recently, Ebbeling et al. measured TEE with doubly labeled water in 162 overweight/obese\nadults randomized to three diets with similar protein and energy content but different carbohydrate\npercentage (high, 60%; moderate, 40%; and low, 20%) [206].  TEE was increased by 52 kcal/day for\nevery 10% decrease in the proportion of carbohydrates from the diet [206]. Participants following the\nlow-carb diets showed significantly lower circulating leptin and ghrelin levels, affecting both hunger\nand energy expenditure [207,208]. This study supported the so-called “carbohydrate-insulin model”,\naccording to which a reduced proportion of dietary carbohydrate drives lower insulin secretion and\nincreases fat mobilization and oxidation, thus leading to enhanced energy expenditure [209–211].\nHowever, this trial has been criticized due to deviations from the planned analyses, the inclusion of\nsubjects with excessive unaccounted energy and other methodological problems [212].\nTherefore, more extensive and methodologically rigorous trials are needed before definitive\nconclusions on this topic can be reached.  At present, the recommendation of combining a proven\nhealthy diet with a daily exercise to obtain/maintain an adequate body muscle mass remains the best\nmethod to prevent a decline in energy expenditure after weight loss.\n6. The Impact of the Gut Microbiota on the Human Energy Balance\nThe gut microbiota, which is the microbial community populating the digestive tract, regulates\nboth metabolism and energy balance in a symbiotic relationship with the human host. Micro-organisms\nextract  energy  from  foods  that  humans  cannot  digest,  producing  bioactive  compounds  such  as\nshort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)—mainly acetate, propionate and butyrate—which supply energy to the\nintestinal epithelium and liver, providing ~10% of the daily caloric requirement [213]. The microbiota\nregulates energy balance through different mechanisms:  gut–brain axis control at both the level of","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/nutrients_and_energy.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"A Critical Review on the Role of Food and Nutrition in the Energy Balance","Author":"Simona Bo, Maurizio Fadda, Debora Fedele, Marianna Pellegrini, Ezio Ghigo and Nicoletta Pellegrini","Subject":"The mass media has increasingly frequently suggested to the general population that specific foods or nutritional schemes are able to affect both human metabolism and energy expenditure, thus facilitating weight loss.

The gut microbiota of obese mice\nhas been shown to display a higher capacity to harvest energy from the diet and genes related to\nphosphotransferase systems involved in microbial carbohydrate processing have been found to be\nincreased in both obese mice and humans [215]. Indeed, the relevance of these processes in the energy\nbalance control has been discussed [218] and an increased pro-inflammatory microbiota, together\nwith the impaired secretion of gut peptides and hormones, seem to be the main mechanisms linking\ndysbiosis to the occurrence of dysmetabolic diseases [215].\nData relative to the role of microbiota in energy expenditure are controversial. The SCFA turnover\nhas been estimated to account for approximately 7% of REE [219], while gut microbiota composition\nwas not associated with REE level [220].\nSupplementation  with  butyrate  enhanced  energy  expenditure  in  mice  by  induction  of\nmitochondrial function in brown fat and skeletal muscle, with increased thermogenesis and fatty acid\noxidation [221]. Supplementation with acetate, the most abundant SCFA in the colon (accounting for\nmore  than  half  of  the  total  fecal  SCFAs),  induced  browning  by  altering  the  expression  of  genes\ninvolved  in  beige  adipogenesis  [222].    An  altered  nutrient  load  induced  rapid  changes  in  the\nhuman  gut  microbiota  composition,  these  changes  being  directly  associated  with  stool  energy\nloss in lean individuals, such that a 20% increase in Firmicutes and a corresponding decrease in\nBacteroidetes was associated with an increased energy harvest of≈150 kcal [8]. The bacterial endotoxin\nlipopolysaccharide—produced by the large gut community of Gram-negative bacteria—binds and\nactivates  Toll-like  receptor  4,  leading  both  to  the  repression  of  adaptive  thermogenesis  through\nendoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction [223],  and the suppression of\nwhite adipose tissue browning [224]. Intriguingly, obesity-induced alterations of the gut microbiome\npersist after successful dieting in obese mice and contribute to weight regain, as persistent dysbiosis\ncontributes to diminishing post-dieting flavonoid levels and reducing energy expenditure [225].\nRecently, a stratification of individuals in enterotypes by gut microbiota composition has been\nproposed, with the most important patterns being the P-type (dominated by Prevotella) and the B-type\n(dominated by Bacteroides), which probably exist as a continuum, rather than separate entities [226].\nThe P-type—characterized by hydrolase activity—has been associated with a high-fiber and resistant\nstarch rich diet; while the B-type—characterized by saccharolytic and proteolytic capacity—has been\nassociated with high-fat, low-fiber, Western-type diets [226]. In response to arabinoxylans from grain\nbran, P-type individuals produced larger amount of SCFAs (especially propionate) and showed higher\nweight loss and improvements in glucose metabolism when compared to B-type individuals [227–229].\nOn the other hand, B-type individuals lose more weight on a bifidogenic diet (rich in inulin and\noligosaccharides) [226]. Should these data be confirmed in larger samples, they suggest a differential\nindividual response to the same food, according to gut microbiota composition and ability to metabolize\nfood, extracting more or less energy from it.  This is in line with emerging concepts of a need for\npersonalized nutrition [230]. Furthermore, complexity in individual microbiota introduces variability\nand errors in the measurement of energy expenditure, which usually are not considered and controlled\nfor, making prediction of the effects of nutrition on the human energy balance extremely complex [11].\n7.

Introduction\nConsuming  adequate  dietary  protein  is  critical  for  maintaining  optimal  health,   growth,\ndevelopment, and function throughout life. Dietary protein requirements in healthy adults (≥19 years\nold) are dictated largely by body mass and lean body mass, as well as net energy balance and physical\nactivity [1]. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) established the current Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)\nfor protein in 2005, including the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), Recommended Dietary\nAllowance (RDA), and the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) [2]. The EAR for\nprotein is 0.66 g per kg body mass per day (g/kg/d) and is defined as the minimum amount of protein\nexpected to meet the individual indispensable amino acid requirements of 50% of the U.S. adult\npopulation.  The RDA, however, is 0.8 g/kg/d, and reflects the minimum amount of dietary protein\nrequired to meet indispensable amino acid requirements, establish nitrogen balance, and prevent muscle\nmass loss for nearly the entire (i.e., 97.5%) U.S. adult population [2,3]. The RDA for American adults is\nsimilar to international adult protein recommendations established by the World Health Organization\n(0.83 g/kg/d) [4].  The current protein RDA, however, is often incorrectly applied when used as the\ndefinition of recommended intake, rather than its true designation as the required minimum intake.\nThis misapplication is problematic for healthy populations and aging adults, and disadvantageous for\nthose with pathophysiological conditions that would necessitate higher-protein needs.\nNutrients2019,11, 1136; doi:10.3390/nu11051136www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/protein.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Dietary Protein and Muscle Mass: Translating Science to Application and Health Benefit","Author":"John W.

Increased protein intake\ncontributes to greater strength and muscle mass gains when coupled with resistance exercise [5],\nallows for greater muscle mass preservation when consumed during periods of negative energy\nbalance [6],  limits age-related muscle loss [7],  and,  to a lesser extent,  provides a greater muscle\nprotein synthetic response when evenly distributed across meals [5,8]. A prospective, cross-sectional\nanalysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database demonstrates\ninverse associations between animal and plant protein intake and waist circumference, body weight,\nand body mass index (BMI) [9]. Advances in this field of nutritional science have translated to a greater\nemphasis on higher-protein diets, protein quality, and supplemental protein in peer-reviewed literature,\nlay media, and the commercial food market. Despite greater awareness of how higher-protein diets\nmight be advantageous for muscle mass, actual dietary patterns, particularly as they pertain to protein,\nhave remained relatively unchanged in American adults as a whole [10].  The disparity between\nknowledge and action raises the question of whether this expanded understanding of dietary protein is\ntruly meaningful if scientific data are not translated and ultimately reflected in nutrition guidance and,\nmore importantly, in what people eat. As such, the purpose of this brief communication is to highlight\ncommon perceptions and benefits of dietary protein on muscle mass, to address misperceptions related\nto higher-protein diets, and to comment on the translation of academic advances to real-life application\nand health benefit.\n2. Dietary Protein and Muscle Mass Perceptions\nSkeletal muscle protein is dynamic and in constant flux, alternating between states of negative\n(i.e., muscle protein synthesis<muscle protein breakdown) and positive (i.e., muscle protein synthesis\n>muscle protein breakdown) protein balance, largely in response to fasting (i.e., postabsorptive) and\nfeeding (i.e., postprandial), respectively.  In the postabsorptive state, muscle protein serves as the\nprimary repository of amino acids that is readily catabolized to release free amino acids that can be\nreincorporated into muscle protein or used to support other critical physiological needs, including\nserving as an energy substrate through carbon skeleton oxidation, as well as by providing gluconeogenic\nprecursors to support euglycemia (Figure 1).   In addition, free amino acids derived from muscle\nprotein breakdown are used in the synthesis of immune system components, plasma proteins, peptide\nhormones, and intra- and extracellular enzymes. Transient periods of negative protein balance in healthy\nadults are completely normal and reversed by feeding. The magnitude of the postprandial stimulation\nof muscle protein synthesis, suppression of muscle (and whole-body) protein breakdown, and shift to\na positive protein balance is mediated by dietary protein content, protein quality (i.e., based on an\nindividual protein’s digestibility and absorption kinetics, and abundance of indispensable amino acids),\nand the format in which protein is consumed (e.g., mixed-macronutrient meal, isolated supplemental\nintact protein, or free-form amino acids) [6]. The collective optimization of these protein intake-related\nfactors can potentiate the beneficial effects of other protein kinetic stimuli, such as the mechanical and\nmetabolic effects of resistance and aerobic exercise, respectively, resulting in the enhanced remodeling\nand repair of existing muscle proteins and synthesis of new muscle protein, providing the conditions\nfor muscle maintenance and growth [11].","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/protein.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Dietary Protein and Muscle Mass: Translating Science to Application and Health Benefit","Author":"John W.

Carbohydrate and fat are important energy\nsubstrates and energy balance is critical to optimal health, but this derivation raises uncertainty about\nthe physiological relevance underlying a recommended upper limit for protein consumption at 35% of\ntotal energy intake.\nSimilarly, the RDA may be sufficient to meet the dietary protein needs of healthy, relatively\nsedentary  young  adults,  though  investigators  have  argued  that  this  recommendation  should  be\nreconsidered based on data from studies demonstrating the inadequacy of the RDA within certain\npopulations when compared to greater requirements derived from the indicator amino acid oxidation\nmethod [16]. Accordingly, internationally recognized professional organizations recommend protein\nintakes  on  the  order  of  double  the  current  RDA  for  physically  active  individuals,  including  the\njoint recommendation to consume protein between 1.2–2.0 g/kg/d established by the Academy of\nNutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine [17].\nThe International Society for Sports Nutrition also recommends protein intake at levels higher than\nthe RDA for physically active individuals (1.4–2.0 g/kg/d) [1]. The definition of the protein RDA itself\ndraws criticism given that it reflects the minimal amount of protein required to prevent deficiency,\nrather than an amount which may allow for optimal health.   The AMDR does provide for more\nflexibility in dietary protein intake recommendations in the context of the complete diet, yet most\nAmerican adults habitually consume protein on the lower end of this range (i.e., 14–16% of total energy\nintake) [10].\n2.2. Dietary Protein and Physical Activity\nThe   benefits   of   consuming   protein   following   resistance   exercise   training   have   been\nwell-documented,  especially  as  they  relate  to  muscle  hypertrophy  and  function  [18].  A  recent\nmeta-analysis showed significant positive associations between coupling resistance exercise with\npost-exercise  protein  ingestion  and  total  fat-free  mass,  strength,  as  measured  by  one-repetition\nmaximum,  and  muscle  size,  as  measured  by  myofiber  cross-sectional  area  [18].   The  type  and\nvolume of exercise plays a determining role in muscle protein synthetic responses to post-exercise\nprotein  ingestion  [19,20],  as  does  age  [21]  and  the  training  experience  [18]  of  the  individual.\nThe type of protein consumed also factors into the net anabolic response, given that postprandial\nmuscle  protein  and  whole-body  protein  kinetic  responses  to  free-form  amino  acids,  isolated\nintact proteins, and mixed-macronutrient meals all differ [22–24].  As reflected in sports nutrition\nrecommendations [1,17], holistic evaluation of varied experimental designs suggests that coupling\npost-resistance exercise protein ingestion (~20–30 g or 0.25–0.30 g/kg) with habitual protein intakes at\n~1.6 g/kg/d promotes favorable muscle adaptations to exercise training [18].\n2.3. Dietary Protein during Energy Deficit\nConsuming higher amounts of protein during typical moderate energy-deficient weight loss\ndiets (i.e., 500–750 kcal/d deficit [25]) preserves muscle mass in an otherwise catabolic physiological\nenvironment [6].  However, the protective effect of higher-protein diets on muscle and whole-body\nprotein homeostasis is compromised as the severity of energy deficit increases beyond 40% of daily\nenergy needs, as a greater proportion of dietary amino acids are oxidized for energy production,\nthereby minimizing amino acid availability to support protein balance [26] (Figure 1).   However,\nmost adults rarely experience acute or sustained periods of severe energy deficit, except for perhaps\nacute fasting for religious reasons, poorly-constructed drastic weight loss plans, preparation and/or\nrecovery from bariatric surgery, or scenarios where food availability is severely limited (e.g., victims","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/protein.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Dietary Protein and Muscle Mass: Translating Science to Application and Health Benefit","Author":"John W.

Regardless of the cause, these periods of severe\nenergy deficit usually manifest only for short durations (e.g., 1–3 days) and, therefore, are likely\nphysiologically tolerable. However, if energy expenditures are high and dietary energy and protein\nintake are limited for extended periods of time, for example during sustained, multi-stressor military\noperations [27,28], the consequences of severe energy deficit are much more problematic, especially\nif body mass and fat-free mass loss are so severe that immune system and muscle function and\nperformance are compromised [29–31]. During those conditions, prioritizing energy intake, more so\nthan focusing solely on protein per se, is vitally important to help prevent excessive muscle catabolism\nand conserve muscle function and performance.  With moderate energy deficit, however, protein\nintakes on the order of double the current RDA (i.e., 1.6 g/kg/d) have proved efficacious in preserving\nmuscle mass during weight loss [6].\n2.4. Pathophysiological Conditions\nInadequate   dietary   protein   intake   challenges   muscle   and   whole-body   protein   balance\n(i.e., protein synthesis=protein breakdown), negatively impacting muscle mass, function, adaptations\nto exercise, bone and calcium homeostasis, immune system response, fluid and electrolyte balance,\nenzyme production and activity, and hormone synthesis. In the absence of sufficient dietary protein\nintake, muscle is catabolized to provide amino acids to allow for continued endogenous protein synthesis\nin critical physiological tissues and organs [32] (Figure 1).  Certain pathophysiological conditions,\nsuch as burns [33], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [34], human immunodeficiency\nvirus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) [35], cancer [36], and sepsis [37], also challenge\nprotein homeostasis, albeit the etiology and mechanisms for disrupted protein balance are generally\nmuch  different  from  those  in  healthy  adults  [38].    Nevertheless,  these  conditions  often  induce\nmuscle wasting,  suggesting that greater dietary protein intakes may be warranted,  with specific\nrecommendations based on the individual patient and clinical scenario.\nWhile  much  focus  has  been  placed  on  adult  protein  needs  in  the  context  of  these  disease\nstates, the potential benefits of higher-protein intakes extend across the lifespan.  Muscle loss and\nfailure-to-thrive are particularly worrisome in the pediatric population, a time typically characterized by\nrapid growth and development. Recent meta-analysis shows that higher protein intakes in critically ill\npediatric patients are associated with positive protein balance, improved clinical outcomes, and lower\nmortality  [39].   These  effects  manifest  at  intakes  above  1.1  g/kg/d  and  become  more  prominent\nwhen protein intakes exceed 1.5 g/kg/d.   Similarly,  unintentional weight loss and decrements in\nmuscle mass in the elderly are predictive of morbidity and mortality, particularly in institutionalized\npopulations [40–42]. Provision of dietary protein at or above 1.2 g/kg/d is associated with reductions\nin unintentional weight loss [43]. Dietary protein supplementation, bringing daily protein intake to\n1.5 g/kg, may also be beneficial in mitigating the detrimental body composition changes and muscle\nmass and function losses associated with sarcopenia [44].  Similarly, consideration should be made\nfor the timing and method of delivery, with isolated, intact proteins providing for a greater anabolic\nresponse than mixed meals [45]. While advanced age does limit the postprandial anabolic response\ntypically observed subsequent to protein feeding [46,47], regular intakes above the current protein\nRDA and consumption of at least 0.4 g/kg (i.e., 0.6 g/kg lean body mass) high quality protein at each\nmeal appear to be critical contributors to preservation of muscle mass and strength that may limit\nfrailty in older populations [42,46,48].  There is also some evidence to support the notion that even\nhigher protein intakes (e.g., 70 g per meal) may be of benefit, in terms of suppressing whole-body\nproteolysis and enhancing net protein balance [49,50].\n3.

Common criticisms of greater protein intakes, or with the types of foods dietary protein is\nderived from, include the potential for detrimental effects of protein on bone, renal function, low-grade\ninflammation, cardiometabolic disease, and cancer risk. These concerns are generally unfounded with\nregard to the protein content of the diet and are antithetical to contemporary published data [52–59].\nTheir persistence, however, and the mislabeling of health detriments to protein itself, as opposed to\nthe whole foods which contribute protein to the overall diet, may underlie lower dietary intakes and\nthereby contribute to suboptimal muscle integrity. While these associations have been corrected in the\nscientific literature, other concerns do warrant thoughtful consideration and should be debated in the\ncontext of whole foods rather than just ascribing protein foods to labels of “non-dairy animal,” “dairy,”\nand “plant,” without consideration of the other nutrients these foods provide and their possible links\nto health and disease [60].\nObservations of hypercalciuria from nearly a century ago in those consuming greater amounts of\nmeat raised concerns that higher protein intakes resulted in increased bone resorption and, therefore,\ndiminished bone mineral density [61]. It was later hypothesized that greater intakes of sulfur-containing\namino acids induce an acidemia that leads to increased bone resorption and calcium release from\nbone as a compensatory mechanism to buffer reductions in pH secondary to higher protein intake [2].\nMore recent data suggest that this conclusion is false, as well-controlled studies using stable isotope\ntracer techniques to assess calcium absorption have shown that the observed hypercalciuria secondary\nto higher protein intake results from increased calcium bioavailability and greater intestinal calcium\nabsorption potentiated by protein [62,63]. Data from NHANES show that dietary acid load and bone\nmineral density are not related in adults who consume adequate calcium [64]. In fact, higher protein\ndiets may actually protect against osteoporosis, in part, as a result of the increased hepatic release of\ninsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) [65].  A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that those with the\nhighest protein intakes had significantly lower hip fracture incidence relative to those with the lowest\nprotein intakes, supporting the assertion that increased dietary protein intake may be protective and\nserve a critical role in accruing and maintaining bone mineral density [66]. The National Osteoporosis\nFoundation recognizes the potential benefit of dietary protein on bone, while advocating for continued\nresearch, particularly the execution of randomized controlled trials that account for dietary calcium\nintake [67].\nHigher-protein  diets  have  also  been  labeled  as  damaging  to  the  kidneys.   Increased  amino\nacid intake can potentiate renal workload and should be reduced in the presence of established\nrenal disease.  However, otherwise healthy kidneys are well-capable of adapting to protein intakes\nabove the RDA and within the AMDR. The kidneys are faced with increased nitrogenous waste as\nmore amino acids are oxidized for energy and/or directed towards gluconeogenesis as the relative\npercentage of energy intake derived from protein increases. In a recent evaluation of NHANES data,\nprotein intake was directly associated with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations, but those in the\nhighest decile for protein intake (~1.4 g/kg/d) still exhibited normal BUN (14.8±0.3; reference range,\n7–20 mg/dL) [9]. This finding held true across non-dairy animal, animal, and plant protein sources and\nneither glomerular filtration rate (GFR) nor blood creatinine concentrations were related to dietary\nprotein content. Similarly, a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with dietary protein\ninterventions showed a small but positive relationship between higher protein intakes (i.e.,≥1.5 g/kg/d\nor≥20% energy intake) and GFR [52].  Overall, current available data suggest higher-protein diets\ndo increase renal workload, but they do not negatively impact kidney health nor increase the risk of\ndeveloping chronic kidney disease in healthy adults.\nRecent studies have raised concerns about the potential for higher-protein intakes to increase\nsystemic inflammation. One large-scale investigation showed that those in the greatest high-sensitivity\nC-reactive protein (hs-CRP) serum concentration quartile also had higher relative protein intakes\nthan the lowest hs-CRP quartile [68]. However, the mean differences in absolute and energy-adjusted\nprotein intakes between the highest and lowest hs-CRP quartiles were only 1.0 and 1.2 g/d, respectively.\nSimilarly, a large controlled dietary intervention study showed greater reductions in hs-CRP with","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/protein.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Dietary Protein and Muscle Mass: Translating Science to Application and Health Benefit","Author":"John W.

In contrast, an analysis of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort\nshows an inverse association between dietary protein intake and inflammation and oxidative stress\nscores, derived from measures of nine inflammatory biomarkers [59]. This potential beneficial effect\nwas observed for higher total and animal protein intakes but was even more pronounced with higher\nplant protein intakes.\nConcern has also been raised regarding potential connections between dietary protein intake\nand  risk  of  cardiometabolic  disease  and  cancer.These  associations  are  typically  confounded\nby  misrepresentation  of  foods  labeled  as  “protein-rich”  which  may,  by  their  nature,  be  overall\nless-healthful  nutrient-sparse  food  options,  providing  high  amounts  of  total  and  saturated  fats\nand  processing  additives  (e.g.,  nitrates,  nitrites,  sodium)  [60].    To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,\nthere  are  no  data  demonstrating  a  well-defined  association  between  dietary  protein  itself  and\ncardiovascular  disease[70,71]or  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  [56].   Similarly,  methionine  restriction\n(e.g., vegan dietary pattern) may be a viable approach to limit carcinogenic processes and tumor\ngrowth [72,73], yet meta-analyses show no link between overall dietary protein intake and incidence\nof colorectal [57] or breast [58] cancers. Higher protein intakes may, however, exert a protective effect\non post-diagnosis survival [74]. A greater emphasis must be placed on dietary protein consumption in\nthe context of overall nutrient-dense, healthy food choices when considering relations to health and\ndisease, as the aforementioned potential connections are influenced heavily by food item quality more\nso than macronutrient profile [55,75].\n4. Translation and Application\nAn  assessment  of  national  dietary  patterns  shows  that  protein  food  intakes  have  remained\nrelatively unchanged over the past decade (i.e., 5.79 ounce equivalents (2005–2006), 5.58 (2007–2008),\n5.74 (2009–2010), 5.70 (2011–2012), 5.83 (2013–2014), 5.80 (2015–2016)), as intake data for the latest\n2-year cycle are nearly identical to those from 10 years earlier [76–81]. This static intake pattern may\nrelate to the regular presentation of recommended protein intakes in a g/d format [82,83], calculated\nfrom anthropometrics assumed when the RDA was crafted in 2005 (i.e., 70 kg male, 57 kg female [2]),\ndespite the fact that contemporary measures are significantly different (i.e., 90 kg average male, 77 kg\naverage female [84]).  A present-day, moderately physically active, average adult male, consuming\nprotein  at  the  RDA,  would  have  an  intake  below  the  low  end  of  the  AMDR  while  maintaining\nenergy  balance.   In  reality,  most  American  adults  consume  ~14–16%  of  total  energy  as  protein\n(1.0–1.5 g/kg/d, depending on age and sex) [10]; an amount greater than the current RDA, but supported\nas beneficial to muscle and overall health by contemporary research. In fact, the Healthy Vegetarian,\nHealthy Mediterranean-Style, and Healthy U.S.-Style eating patterns promoted in the 2015 Dietary\nGuidelines for Americans equate to protein intakes 1.55-, 1.94-, and 1.98-fold greater than the current\nRDA, respectively (theoretical 19–50 year old female consuming 2000 kcal/d) [85].  If the American\nadult population, as a whole, consumed protein at approximately 1.6 g/kg/d, as advocated in a recent\nreview from one of the more prominent laboratory groups in this field [5], this would still represent\nan approximate 17–19% of total energy intake, certainly reasonable based on the current AMDR for\nprotein. Indeed, even increasing to 2.5–3.0 g/kg/d would still fall within the 10–35% of total energy from\nprotein suggested by the AMDR and would provide ample opportunity to optimize muscle health.\nIn  addition  to  the  dietary  protein  and  skeletal  muscle  considerations,  the  protein  leverage\nhypothesis suggests that protein under-consumption increases appetite drive in an effort to ensure\nsufficient amino acid intake [86]. The unfortunate effect of this response in the absence of increased\nprotein intake is excess energy consumption and resultant positive energy balance. The fact that over\n120 million Americans have some type of cardiovascular disease [87], over 29 million are believed\nto have type 2 diabetes mellitus [88], and approximately 5–7% of the young adult population meets\nthe diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome [89] illustrates the need to change how we structure","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/protein.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Dietary Protein and Muscle Mass: Translating Science to Application and Health Benefit","Author":"John W.

Improper application of\nthe protein RDA in federal policy, which informs institutional feeding practices, can result in dietary\nprotein intakes that may be sub-optimal for muscle growth and preservation and overall health. As an\nexample, the National School Lunch Act (Section 17(o)(1)) requires that participating programs provide\n“approximately one-third of the daily recommended dietary allowance” [90]. In practice, this means\nthat American school children are required to be provided with one-third of the minimum amount of\ndietary protein needed to prevent dysfunction, rather than one-third of the amount which may best\nsupport muscle mass, growth, and health. Given the relative cost of protein-rich foods and concerns\nfor cost-efficiency amongst school breakfast and lunch program administrators [91], it is reasonable to\nexpect that protein offerings are reflective of the minimum requirement, rather than robust provision\nfor optimal health.\nCertainly,  food  choices  within  macronutrient  recommendations  are  critical,  with  a  needed\nemphasis on nutrient-dense selections [92]. Similarly, we recognize the traditional association between\nhigher-protein diets and higher meat consumption and the much-needed focus on sustainability\nand  the  potential  environmental  impact  of  our  food  sources.   With  these  in  mind,  we  strongly\nencourage the reevaluation of macronutrient recommendations to best reflect high quality science,\nbasing them on experimental studies over observational data [93]. Implementing reliable macronutrient\nrecommendations for both healthy and diseased populations at all stages of the lifecycle, which engender\nconsumer confidence, can then be followed by greater emphasis on quality food choices within those\nguidelines. Such action would allow for dietary protein recommendations, and resultant public health\npolicy, best designed to provide for muscle accretion, quality, and preservation throughout the lifespan.\nA realignment of macronutrient intake recommendations with contemporary research findings would\ncreate the foundation for advances in public health.\nAuthor Contributions:J.W.C. and S.M.P. conceptualized, wrote, reviewed, and approved this manuscript.\nFunding:This research received no external funding.\nAcknowledgments:The authors like to thank Jillian Allen for her assistance with manuscript development.\nConflicts of Interest:The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy\nAbstract\nWe performed a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression to determine if increasing daily protein inges-\ntion contributes to gaining lean body mass (LBM), muscle strength, and physical/functional test performance in\nhealthy subjects. A protocol for the present study was registered (PROSPERO, CRD42020159001), and a systematic\nsearch of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Sciences databases was undertaken. Only randomized controlled tri-\nals (RCT) where participants increased their daily protein intake and were healthy and non-obese adults were included.\nResearch questions focused on the main effects on the outcomes of interest and subgroup analysis, splitting the studies\nby participation in a resistance exercise (RE), age (<65 or≥65 years old), and levels of daily protein ingestion.\nThree-level random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions were conducted on data from 74 RCT. Most of the se-\nlected studies tested the effects of additional protein ingestion during RE training. The evidence suggests that increas-\ning daily protein ingestion may enhance gains in LBM in studies enrolling subjects in RE (SMD [standardized mean\ndifference] = 0.22, 95% CI [95% confidence interval] 0.14:0.30,P<0.01, 62 studies, moderate level of evidence).\nThe effect on LBM was significant in subjects≥65 years old ingesting 1.2–1.59 g of protein/kg/day and for younger sub-\njects (<65 years old) ingesting≥1.6 g of protein/kg/day submitted to RE. Lower-body strength gain was slightly higher\nby additional protein ingestion at≥1.6 g of protein/kg/day during RE training (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI 0.09:0.35,\nP<0.01, 19 studies, low level of evidence). Bench press strength is slightly increased by ingesting more protein in\n<65 years old subjects during RE training (SMD = 0.18, 95% CI 0.03:0.33,P= 0.01, 32 studies, low level of evidence).\nThe effects of ingesting more protein are unclear when assessing handgrip strength and only marginal for performance\nin physical function tests. In conclusion, increasing daily protein ingestion results in small additional gains in LBM and\nlower body muscle strength gains in healthy adults enrolled in resistance exercise training. There is a slight effect on\nbench press strength and minimal effect performance in physical function tests. The effect on handgrip strength is\nunclear.\nKeywordsMuscle mass; Muscle strength; Protein quantity; Physical function\nReceived:13June2021; Revised:5January2022; Accepted:10January2022\n*Correspondence to: Stuart M.

For example, the current Recom-\nmended Dietary Allowance in the USA and Canada is 0.8 g\nprotein/kg BW/day,\n17\nthe FAO of the UN/WHO recommen-\ndation is 0.83 g/kg BW/day,\n18\nand the European Food Safety\nAuthority also established its population reference intake\nfor protein as 0.83 g/kg BW/day for all adults. These dietary\nprotein intake recommendations have traditionally been the\nsame for adults (>18 years old), regardless of age or sex.\nNevertheless, a higher daily protein intake (1.2–1.6 g/kg\nBW/day) has been suggested to improve lean body mass\ngain or maintain muscle mass in young and old healthy\nadults.\n5,10,19\nPrevious meta-analyses have been conducted to ascertain\nwhether additional protein ingestion is linked to increases\nin LBM (i.e. muscle mass), muscle strength, or physical func-\ntion in adults.\n13,14,20–23\nHowever, the effects of protein inges-\ntion independent of RE are not commonly explored.\n13,22\nFurthermore, the population inclusion criteria in previous\nmeta-analyses have, we propose, led to confusion in the in-\nterpretation of the results. Meta-analyses of studies testing\nweight loss protocols, including obese subjects or subjects\nwith chronic illnesses, sarcopenia, frailty, chronic diseases,\nor multigradient supplements, make it challenging to trans-\nlate thefindings.\n13,20–22\nWe performed a systematic review, meta-analysis, and\nmeta-regression to determine if providing additional dietary\nprotein (protein to exceed participants’habitual protein in-\ntake) contributes to increasing LBM (i.e. muscle mass,\nfat-free mass, lean soft-tissue mass, bone and fat-free mass),\nstrength, and physical/functional test performance in healthy\nadult subjects who were free from conditions that have been\nshown to affect skeletal muscle protein turnover and muscle\nfunction. Also, we sought to know if additional protein inges-\ntion affects the proposed outcomes independent of RE and\nage. We hypothesized that additional protein ingestion would\nimprove all outcomes, independent of age or the perfor-\nmance of RE; however, there may be a dose–response effect.\nMethods\nThis systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression\nfollowed the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-\ntematic  Reviews  of  Interventions\n24\nand  the  Preferred\nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\n(PRISMA) report.\n25\nThe procedures for identification, screen-\ning, data extraction, and analysis were agreed upon in ad-\nvance by the team of researchers involved in the study.\nDetails of the intended methods were documented in ad-\nvance in a protocol registered at the International Prospec-\ntive  Register  of  Systematic  Reviews  (PROSPERO,  CRD\nCRD42020159001) before literature search, data extraction,\nand analysis.\nEligibility criteria\nThe research questions were established using the PICOS\n(population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and set-\nting) criteria (Table1). Participants were untrained or\ntrained healthy men or women 18 or older. Studies including\nweight loss diet protocols, obese, and subjects with any di-\nagnosed or self-reported disease were not included. Studies\nincluding obese subjects were excluded since it has been\nshown that obesity negatively affects postprandial myofibril-\nlar protein synthetic response to nutrition and exercise.\n26\nAlso, interventions were carefully screened for the presence\nof any potential active ingredient that might impact lean\nbody mass gain other than protein (i.e. creatine, phospha-\ntidic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, anabolic steroids, and beta-\nhydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate [HMB]). If a particular study\ntesting potential active supplements had intervention groups\nfitting our inclusion criteria, the study was included and\nassessed to extract the respective data of protein and\ncontrol/placebo interventions only. No restrictions were im-\nposed regarding additional protein dose or the duration of\nthe intervention protocol.\nSystematic search strategy\nA literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCT) in-\nvestigating the effect of ingesting additional protein on lean\nbody mass, muscle strength, and physical test performance\nin healthy adults was conducted up to September 2020 by\n796E.A.

If\nnot available in tables or the text, data were extracted from\nfigures using the online tool WebPlotDigitizer.\n28\nRisk of bias, heterogeneity, quality of the evidence,\nand sensitivity analysis\nThe risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Col-\nlaboration risk-of-bias tool using RevMan5 by two team\nmembers (E. A. N. and S. M.

Studies not reporting randomization or blinding pro-\ncedures were considered high risk in the domain allocation\nconcealment and blinding of participants and personnel. Also,\nattrition, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and\nother sources of bias were assessed. Cochrane’sQwas em-\nployed to detect statistical heterogeneity andI\n2\nstatistic to\nquantify the magnitude of statistical heterogeneity between\nstudies whereI\n2\n30% to 60% represents moderate andI\n2\n60% to 90% represents substantial heterogeneity across stud-\nies. The quality of the evidence was assessed by two team\nmembers (E. A. N. and S. M. P.) using the Grading of Recom-\nmendations  Assessment,  Development,  and  Evaluation\n(GRADE) system of rating uploading the list of studies on\nGRADEpro platform (https://gdt.gradepro.org/) and perform-\ning the grading manually.\n30\nFunnel plots were generated for\nvisual assessment for asymmetry and potential publication\nbias\n31\n(seeFiguresS20–S29). Studies identified as potential\noutliers during the visual analysis of funnel plots and assessed\nwith three (3) or more domains judged as potentially high risk\nof bias were submitted to sensitivity analyses. These analyses\nwere conducted for all outcomes by the‘remove 1’technique\nto assess whether individual studies had a disproportionate\neffect on the meta-analyses results\n32\n(TablesS6–S10).\nStatistical analysis\nThe analysis was conducted using change from baseline to\nimmediate post-treatment data (means, standard deviations)\nfor both intervention and control/placebo groups to generate\nthe summary measures of effect in the form of standardized\nmean difference (SMD). Means and standard deviation (SD)\nfor changes were calculated or imputed from the available\ndata in the paper. Correlation coefficients were estimated\nfrom the data and used to impute missing SD for change\nfor some studies according to the methods described in the\nCochrane   Handbook   for   Systematic   Reviews   of\nInterventions.\n24\nCalculated correlation coefficients were in\nthe range of 0.7–0.9 for all outcomes. Therefore, a median\npoint of 0.8 was applied as the correlation coefficient for\nany necessary SD imputation.\nThe SMD was used as a summary statistic since studies in\nthis systematic review often assessed the same outcome\nmeasured in various ways (i.e. muscle mass, lean body mass,\nbone and fat-free mass and lower body strength measured by\nleg press, squat, or leg extension). In this situation, it was\nnecessary to standardize the results of the studies before\nthey could be compared across studies or combined in the\nquantitative synthesis. SMDs were estimated using Hedge’s\ng approach (also known as bias-corrected effect size). The\nSMDs of 0.2–0.5, 0.5–0.8, and>0.8 were considered small,\nmedium, and large effects, respectively. To analyse physical\nperformance measures, we standardized the direction of ef-\nfect to ensure consistency of desirable outcome responses\n(i.e. a reduction measured in seconds to cover a given dis-\ntance reflects a faster gait speed and thus a better outcome,\nwhereas an increase in gait speed measured in m/s reflects a\npositive outcome). Similarly, a reduction in the sit-to-stand\ntest (s),five chair repetition test (s), and timed up-and-go test\n(s) is desirable. When available, multiple data were extracted\nfrom the same study for lower-body strength or performance\nin physical tests and included in the analysis.\nWe used a random-effects three-level meta-analytic ap-\nproach to account for dependency between effect sizes (i.e.\nthe correlation between effect sizes due to multiple mea-\nsures or sub-measures of the same outcome within a study\nor the comparison of multiple interventions to a single con-\ntrol group). In such cases, multiples measures and compari-\nsons from the same study are nested within studiesfirst,\nand variance in observed effect sizes is decomposed into\nsampling   variance,   with-in   study   variance,   and\nbetween-study variance to account for intracluster (or\nintraclass) correlation in the true effects. In addition, we sub-\nmitted the data to three-level meta-regression analyses\nbased on the use of exercise/resistance training (‘yes’or\n‘no’), age (<65 vs.≥65 years old), and the level of protein in-\ntake (continuous as g/kg/day or categorical—‘<1.2 g/kg/day’,\n‘1.2–1.59 g/kg/day’and‘≥1.6 g/kg/day’) when possible.

To our knowledge, this\nis thefirst systematic review and meta-analysis investigating\nsuch outcomes restricting the literature search to studies\nwith healthy, not obese adults (i.e. no minor illnesses, not\nfrail, and not sarcopenic), and including no weight-loss study\nprotocols. Furthermore, the literature search was restricted\nto studies testing protein interventions only (i.e. no addi-\ntional supplement ingredients). Finally, when considering\nphysical activity intervention, only resistance exercise was in\nour inclusion criteria. The mainfindings of the present\nmeta-analysis were that additional protein ingestion together\nwith RE leads to small additional lean body mass and lower\nbody strength. This effect seems to be more prominent in\nyounger subjects ingesting≥1.6 g/kg/day when enrolled in\nRE. The number of studies with healthy older subjects to con-\nduct a proper analysis is relatively low what levels down the\ncertainty of the evidence. Effects on bench press strength,\nhandgrip strength, and improved performance in physical\ntests in healthy adults seem to be trivial. For most outcomes,\nthe evidence is unclear due to the low number of studies or\nincreased heterogeneity. A criticalfinding of our systematic\nreview is that more RCT testing increasing protein ingestion\nas a solo intervention in healthy, not obese, adults are\nneeded.\nMost meta-analyses have reported consistently positive\nresults regarding the effect of additional protein ingestion\non RE training-induced increases in LBM.\n13,14,21,23\nCermak\net al.\n23\nshowed a significant main effect for protein supple-\nmentation in muscle mass in young and old subjects during\nresistance exercise-like training. Tagawaet al.\n13\nfound signif-\nicant effects of additional protein ingestion on LBM in adults\n(19–81  years  old)  independent  of  resistance  exercise\n(≥2 weeks). Wirthet al.\n21\nalso found a significant effect of\nadditional protein ingestion on LBM in adults (18–55 years\nold or≥55 years old). Conversely, Haafet al.\n22\nfound no ef-\nfect  of  additional protein  supplementation  in  LBM  in\nnon-frail community-dwelling older adults (>50 years old),\neven when combined with resistance exercise (≥4 weeks).\nNoteworthy, is the fact that divergent inclusion criteria are\nan important source of variability when comparing different\nmeta-analyses.  The  insertion  of  clinical  trials  testing\nmulti-ingredient supplements,\n106\nincluding energy-restricted\nweight-loss diets,\n13\nor using different cut-off points for age\nsub-groups likely explain the differences in main effects\nand conclusions when comparing studies.\n14,21–23\nStill, a\nmeta-analysis conducted by our group showed that protein\ningestion   could   significantly   increase   the   RE\ntraining-induced gains in lean mass in young (<45 years\nold) and old (≥45 years old) healthy subjects.\n14\nOne of the\npresent meta-analysis objectives was to expand our previous\nfindings to studies that have included protein supplements\nbut not having subjects enrolled in RE training. However, af-\nter a systematic review, we identified only six studies\nmatching our criteria, which restricts the possibility of a\nproper analysis.\nOur data show a small increment in LBM caused by\ningesting additional protein and RE. Older subjects would\nlikely respond differently since anabolic resistance develops\nwith ageing, and higher per-meal protein doses are postu-\nlated to be necessary to stimulate muscle protein synthesis\nin this population.\n107\nPresent protein ingestion recommen-\ndations for healthy young and old subjects range from\n0.67 to 0.8 g/kg BW/day.\n17,18\nThis meta-analysis also found\nthat LBM was slightly increased by protein and RE in older\nsubjects  in  studies  testing  daily  protein  ingestion  at\n1.2–1.59 g/kg/day.

Therefore, because the effect of protein\nsupplementation is significant only when Nakayamaet al.\n76\ndata are included in the analysis, it is possible that resis-\ntance exerciseper seis the main contributor to lean body\nmass gains in studies with older participants. Curiously, our\nstudy showed a significant effect of ingesting more protein\nand RE in younger subjects only when ingesting≥1.6 g of\nprotein/kg/day. Our currentfindings in some way support\nthe hypothesis that higher daily protein ingestion may be\nneeded to increase LBM in young\n108\nand maybe older\nhealthy subjects.\n109\nNoteworthy, as highlighted in our re-\nsults, most of the studies included in our analysis (~80%) re-\nported baseline daily protein ingestion of at least 1.2 g/kg\nBW. This is 50% higher than current protein ingestion rec-\nommendations for healthy adults.\n17,18\nSuch observation\nmight explain the small effect of the intervention on the dif-\nferent outcomes. A relevant question is how much of LBM\nis muscle mass?\n110\nThis question is relevant as protein\nsupplementation  rarely  substantially  affects  strength\noutcomes,\n14,21–23\nwhich highlights that the extra LBM gain\nstimulated  by  protein  supplementation  may  not  be\nmuscle,\n111\nor at least not sufficient muscle that is contribut-\ning to increases in strength.\nAccording to previous meta-analyses from our group and\nothers, the effects of increasing daily protein ingestion on\nmuscle strength are highly variable.\n14,21–23\nPrevious data\nfrom our group\n14\nand Cermaket al.\n23\nshowed very small\nbut significant effect of additional protein ingestion on\nstrength, mainly lower body strength data when selecting\nRE studies. In contrast, Wirthet al.\n21\nand Haafet al.\n22\nfound\nno effect of additional protein ingestion and exercise on\nlower-body strength. However, some particularities in the in-\nclusion criteria in these two meta-analyses (i.e. aerobic exer-\ncise training or the cut-off point during age subgroup\nanalysis) might cause such contrast compared with ourfind-\nings. Our current data support a small effect of ingesting\nmore protein on lower-body strength. Still, a high daily pro-\ntein ingestion (≥1.6 g/kg BW/day) might be necessary to in-\ncrease strength in the lower body. Such a level of protein\ningestion represents twice the current RDA for protein for\nhealthy adults.\n17\nThis observation reinforces the idea that op-\ntimal skeletal muscle increases in strength during RE, while\nsmall, might require greater protein ingestion.\n14\nHandgrip strength has been positively linked to several rel-\nevant variables related to the quality of life and physical func-\ntion, especially for older subjects.\n112\nAlso, growing evidence\nshows that handgrip strength is associated with total\nstrength, bone mineral density, fractures, falls, cognitive im-\npairment, depression levels, and overall diet quality.\n112,113\nHowever, because few studies investigated the effect of\nprotein ingestion on handgrip strength in healthy adults,\nit is unclear if additional protein ingestion would improve\nthis outcome. The search strategy used in the present\nmeta-analysis selected 10 studies investigating handgrip\nstrength changes due to additional protein ingestion. Never-\ntheless, onlyfive studies did not enrol participants in a RE\ntraining protocol.\nAs mentioned, handgrip strength seems to be considered a\npotential marker related to several aspects of functional ca-\npacity and quality of life.\n112,113\nHowever, we intended to ex-\nplore  the  effects  of  additional  protein  ingestion  in\nfunctional tests directly. We found a small marginal effect\nof protein ingestion on performance in physical function\ntests. Our results are in line with a previous meta-analysis\n22\nshowing no significant effect of protein ingestion added to\nRE on gait speed or chair-rise time in healthy subjects. In con-\ntrast, Liaoet al.\n106\nfound additive significant main effects for\nadditional protein (but included numerous other supplement\ningredients) ingestion and RE in the performance of physical\nfunction tests in older overweight or obese subjects. Of note,\nLiaoet al.\n106\ncompared the effect of additional protein inges-\ntion and RE with no intervention as a control group; there-\nfore, it is reasonable to suggest that the RE was the primary\nintervention leading to the mainfindings.\nThere are several strengths of this review. We restricted\nour search to studies with healthy non-obese adults. We\nthink this is essential to reduce the influence of minor ill-\nnesses such as diagnosed sarcopenia, frailty, arthritis, and\neven obesity, which have all been shown to perturb muscle\nprotein turnover.\n26\nOur inclusion criteria excluded studies\nusing multi-ingredient supplements or combining other\nadded nutrients or compounds in the intervention group to\nisolate the effect of protein. Also, we restricted our system-\natic search and inclusion criteria to research including resis-\ntance exercise only if a study included physical activity.\nAltogether, these criteria are essential to narrow ourfindings\nto the effect of additional protein in healthy adults. Finally,\nwe applied GRADE to qualify our level of evidence. Using\nGRADE, we show that despite being statistically significant,\nsome of ourfindings were downgraded in terms of certainty,\nhighlighting that study design issues hamper making further\nconclusions. The main reasons for downgrading the certainty\nof evidence were increased risk of bias, mainly in the blinding\ndomains, moderate to high heterogeneity, and, for some sub-\ngroup analysis, the low number of the subject in each respec-\ntive group. In some way, this highlights that future studies\ntesting additional protein as a primary intervention and ex-\namining outcomes relevant to strength and lean body mass\nneed to focus on trial planning and control of variables\nknown to affect study quality.

Most of the selected studies\nin this meta-analysis (65 out of 74) provided animal protein\nto their subjects. Therefore, ourfindings reflect mainly the ef-\nfect of animal-based protein sources.\n11\nApproximately a quar-\nter of the selected studies showed an increased risk of bias\ndue to poor blinding during the study or the data analysis\n(FiguresS1 and S2). The relevance of such increased risk of\nbias escalates when subgrouping studies by age or levels of\ndaily protein intake. Consequently, some conclusions pre-\nsented in the current meta-analysis might change in the fu-\nture in the case of the addition of studies with improved\nblinding procedures.\nIn conclusion, our systematic review showed few studies\ntesting protein intervention in healthy non-obese subjects\nand assessing LMB, strength, or physical function outcomes\nin the absence of a parallel RE training program. Therefore,\nmore studies are needed to conduct a proper meta-analysis\nand answer our research question regarding the use of die-\ntary protein intervention solely in healthy subjects. Alterna-\ntively, the evidence in this meta-analysis supports the\nhypothesis  that  additional  protein  ingestion  (1.6  g  of\nprotein/kg/day or higher) leads to small increments in lean\nbody mass in studies enrolling young subjects in RE training.\nThe results on older subjects seem marginal or influenced\nby individual studies. Lower body muscle strength was also\nmarginally increased by additional protein ingestion in stud-\nies with RE training. Bench press strength, handgrip strength,\nand performance in physical or functional tests were slightly\nor not affected by ingestion of additional protein. Notewor-\nthy, 80% of the studies reported subjects ingesting at least\n1.2 g of protein/kg/day in their habitual diets. Such baseline\nprotein ingestion is a potential contributor for minor or the\nabsence of additional effects of a protein intervention in\ncombination with RE. Still, the downgrading of the evidence\nfor some outcomes in the current meta-analysis highlights\nthe necessity of more studies testing protein interventions\nin healthy subjects with improved planning of RCTs, fulfilling\nimportant aspects as proper blinding of research participants\nand staff.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors of this manuscript certify that they comply with\nthe ethical guidelines for authorship and publishing in the\nJournal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle.\n114\nThis work\nwas conducted by an expert group of the European branch\nof the International Life Sciences Institute, ILSI Europe.

Following a 2-week preparatory phase, par-\nticipants were randomly assigned to either a high-volume (VOL;n=14,\n4910–12 repetitions with~70% of one repetition maximum [1RM], 1-min\nrest intervals) or a high-intensity (INT;n=15, 493–5 repetitions with\n~90% of 1RM, 3-min rest intervals) training group for 8 weeks. Pre- and\nposttraining assessments included lean tissue mass via dual energy x-ray\nabsorptiometry, muscle cross-sectional area and thickness of the vastus later-\nalis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), pectoralis major, and triceps brachii muscles\nvia ultrasound images, and 1RM strength in the back squat and bench press\n(BP) exercises. Blood samples were collected at baseline, immediately post,\n30 min post, and 60 min postexercise at week 3 (WK3) and week 10 (WK10)\nto assess the serum testosterone, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth\nfactor-1 (IGF1), cortisol, and insulin concentrations. Compared to VOL,\ngreater  improvements  (P<0.05)  in  lean  arm  mass  (5.2\u00012.9%  vs.\n2.2\u00015.6%) and 1RM BP (14.8\u00019.7% vs. 6.9\u00019.0%) were observed for\nINT. Compared to INT, area under the curve analysis revealed greater\n(P<0.05) GH and cortisol responses for VOL at WK3 and cortisol only at\nWK10. Compared to WK3, the GH and cortisol responses were attenuated\n(P<0.05)  for  VOL  at  WK10,  while  the  IGF1  response  was  reduced\n(P<0.05) for INT. It appears that high-intensity resistance training stimulates\ngreater improvements in some measures of strength and hypertrophy in resis-\ntance-trained men during a short-term training period.\nIntroduction\nResistance training is an effective tool for stimulating\nmuscle hypertrophy and improving strength. By manipu-\nlating acute training variables (i.e., exercise selection and\norder, intensity, volume, and duration, frequency, and\nrest intervals), differences in mechanical and metabolic\nstresses can be imposed (Toigo and Boutellier 2006; Rata-\nmess et al. 2009). As the intensity of resistance exercise\nincreases (resulting in increased activation of fast-twitch\nmuscle fibers), a greater emphasis is placed on mechanical\nstress (Henneman et al. 1965). In contrast, high-volume\n(i.e., greater number of repetitions concomitant with the\nuse of short rest intervals) programs elicit greater meta-\nbolic stress (Ratamess et al. 2009). A minimum intensity\nthreshold is necessary to maximally stimulate muscle acti-\nvation  for  those  programs  targeting  metabolic  stress\n(Kraemer  and  Ratamess  2005;  Ratamess  et al.  2009).\nThus, metabolic stress is targeted by increasing resistance\nexercise volume and volume load and by reducing rest\nª2015 The Authors.Physiological  Reportspublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of\nthe American Physiological Society and The Physiological Society.\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License,\nwhich permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n2015 | Vol. 3 | Iss. 8 | e12472\nPage 1\nPhysiological Reports ISSN 2051-817X","metadata":{"source":"/Users/michaelroytman/Desktop/Michael_Portfolio/documents/training.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.3","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"The effect of training volume and intensity on improvements in muscular strength and size in resistancetrained men","Creator":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.531/W Unicode","Producer":"PDFlib PLOP 2.0.0p6 (SunOS)/Acrobat Distiller 10.1.1 (Windows)","CreationDate":"D:20150811162420+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20150828021546-04'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2015-08-11T16:24:20+05:30","xmp:creatortool":"Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.531/W Unicode","xmp:modifydate":"2015-08-11T16:25:29+05:30","xmp:metadatadate":"2015-08-11T16:25:29+05:30","pdf:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 10.1.1 (Windows)","dc:title":"Onl_Er_phy2_12472_GA 1..18"}},"totalPages":17},"loc":{"pageNumber":1}}}],["6ad42dc2-292d-4232-ba6b-f3724a9b814e",{"pageContent":"intervals between sets (Kraemer and Ratamess 2005; Rata-\nmess et al. 2009).

It has been suggested that high volume, moderate-\nto-high intensity resistance exercise programs utilizing\nshort rest intervals primarily target muscle hypertrophy\nwith secondary strength increases (Baechle et al. 2008;\nRatamess et al. 2009).

However, it has been hypothesized that mus-\ncle hypertrophy may increase substantially across a larger\nspectrum of intensity and volume combinations (Schroe-\nder et al. 2013).\nThe general recommendation of high-volume, moder-\nate-to-high intensity programs utilizing short rest inter-\nvals was based on empirical evidence suggesting that this\ntraining  paradigm  is  typically  used  by  bodybuilders\n(Hackett et al. 2013) during hypertrophy phases of peri-\nodized training for athletes (Ratamess et al. 2009), and by\nstudies reporting greater increases in muscle hypertrophy\nas  training  volume  (i.e.,  number  of  sets  performed)\nincreases (Kraemer 1997; Kraemer et al. 2000; Marx et al.\n2001; Goto et al. 2004). Although major health organiza-\ntions such as the American College of Sports Medicine\nhave recommended a multitude of loading and volume\nstrategies in a periodized manner for advanced hypertro-\nphy training, the moderate-to-high intensity range (6–\n12 RM) has been regarded as an effective hypertrophy\ntraining zone that thought to provide a sufficient balance\nof mechanical and metabolic stress to the trainee (Rata-\nmess et al. 2009).\nA high training volume is associated with an aug-\nmented anabolic hormone response to exercise (Kraemer\net al. 1990; Crewther et al. 2008; McCaulley et al. 2009)\nthat thought to provide an enhanced stimulus for muscle\nhypertrophy (McCall et al. 1999; West and Phillips 2012).\nHowever, these studies extrapolated the acute endocrine\nresponse to a single bout of resistance exercise to changes\nin skeletal muscle mass over time or simply related\nchange scores. Although exogenously administered ana-\nbolic hormones (i.e., testosterone) have been shown to\nlinearly increase lean tissue accruement (Bhasin et al.\n2001), no studies have demonstrated a consistent relation-\nship between elevations in the endogenous anabolic hor-\nmone response during resistance exercise using multiple\njoint structural exercises and increases in muscle mass.\nFurthermore, investigations comparing the acute anabolic\nhormone  response  to  different  resistance  exercise\nprotocols  (e.g.,  traditional  hypertrophy,  strength,  or\npower designs) have been unable to demonstrate that a\ngreater metabolic stress is more advantageous for stimu-\nlating  augmented  testosterone  and  IGF-1  responses\n(Kraemer et al. 1990; Schwab et al. 1993; McKay et al.\n2008; McCaulley et al. 2009; West et al. 2009, 2010;\nHasani-Ranjbar et al. 2012). Interestingly, high-volume\ntraining programs have consistently elicited a greater cor-\ntisol response to training (Hakkinen and Pakarinen 1993;\nCrewther et al. 2008; Buresh et al. 2009; McCaulley et al.\n2009; West et al. 2010). Although chronically high levels\nof cortisol are associated with decreases in lean muscle\nmass (Crowley and Matt 1996; Schakman et al. 2013), the\neffects of transient elevations in cortisol thought to medi-\nate, in part, tissue remodeling remains poorly understood.\nThus, the hypertrophic impact of acute anabolic hormone\nelevations remains unclear. An alternative perspective sug-\ngests that greater mechanical stress associated with high-\nintensity resistance training may recruit more fast-twitch\nmuscle fibers and provide a greater stimulus for muscle\nhypertrophy than the metabolic stress associated with\nhigh-volume  training  (Clarkson  et al.  1992;  Ratamess\net al. 2009), but further research is warranted examining\nthe hypertrophic effects of protocols targeting mechanical\nand metabolic stress, or a combination of both.\nA major research limitation is that most studies exam-\nined hypertrophic adaptations in previously untrained or\nmoderately trained populations. Program efficacy differ-\nentiation is difficult in untrained populations because\nuntrained individuals respond favorably to a multitude of\ntraining stimuli. As the “window of adaptation” decreases\nduring long-term resistance training, more scientific rec-\nommendations are needed to properly address program\ndesign  in  trained  populations  targeting  strength  and\nhypertrophy increases (Ratamess et al. 2009). However,\nstudies comparing high-intensity to high-volume training\nprograms in resistance-trained individuals are few. These\ninvestigations have shown that high-intensity training is\nmore beneficial for strength enhancement, but similar to\nhigh-volume  training  protocols  for  enhancing  muscle\nhypertrophy (Brandenburg and Docherty 2002; Schoen-\nfeld et al. 2014). However, some methodological limita-\ntions (e.g., program design and hypertrophy assessment)\nraise questions regarding the efficacy of each program\ntype in stimulating strength and hypertrophy increases. In\naddition,  the  endocrine  response  to  training  remains\nunclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to\ncompare  a  moderate  intensity,  high-volume  training\nprogram utilizing short rest intervals to a high-intensity,\nlower volume program utilizing a longer rest intervals in\nresistance-trained individuals. Muscle strength, hypertro-\nphy,  and  endocrine  responses  were  measured  before\nand following the 8-week training period.

Subsequently,   participants   were\nrandomly assigned to one of two training groups: a high-\nintensity,  low-volume  training  group  (INT;n=15;\n24.7\u00013.4 years;  90.0\u000115.3 kg;  179.5\u00015.6 cm)  or\na  high-volume,  moderate  intensity  training  group\n(VOL;n=14;   24.0\u00012.7 years;   90.1\u000111.7 kg;\n169.9\u000129.0 cm). Blood samples were collected on day 1\nof week 3 (WK3; the first week of training after the base\ntraining period) and week 10 (WK10). Each group com-\npleted an 8-week resistance training program (four ses-\nsions per week) under the direct supervision of certified\nstrength and conditioning specialists (CSCS).\nParticipants\nThirty-three  physically  active,  resistance-trained  men\n(24.0\u00013.0 years; 90\u000113.8 kg; 174.9\u000120.7 cm) agreed\nto participate in this study. Following an explanation of\nall procedures, risks, and benefits, each participant pro-\nvided his informed consent to participate in the study.\nThis investigation was approved by the New England\nInstitutional Review Board. All participants were free of\nany physical limitations (determined by medical history\nquestionnaire and PAR-Q) and had been regularly partici-\npating (at the time of recruitment) in resistance training\nfor a minimum of 2 years (5.7\u00012.2 years).\nA major limitation in previous studies is that the par-\nticipants’ prior training habits were under reported. For\nexample, if participants were following a similar type pro-\ngram to the one used in the study then one would expect\nfewer improvements. However, if participants were train-\ning using a very different type of program compared to\nthe one used in the study then the change in stimulus\ncould lead to improvements and hyperinflate the efficacy\nof the program. Thus, it is imperative for hypertrophy\nresearch to accurately depict prior training of the partici-\npants. Prior to the present investigation, all of the partici-\npants described their training habits to be different from\nthe present training regimen in terms of exercise order\nand groupings. Approximately 82% of the participants\ndescribed their normal repetition range to be either lower\n(VOL=77%) or higher (INT=87%) than what they\nwere assigned in the study, with about 43% typically\nusing a 6–10 RM range and another 21% using an alter-\nnating (or pyramid) structure for specific multiple joint\nstructural and assistance exercises. Additionally, 50% of\nthe   participants   reported   using   either   longer\n(VOL=54%) or shorter (INT=47%) rest periods, while\napproximately 29% did not track their rest times previ-\nously.

In comparison to the\ntraining  intervention  groups,  the  exercises  (and  their\norder) were identical but the volume (6–8 RM) and rest\nintervals (1–2 min) differed.\nAnthropometric and morphologic\nassessments\nAnthropometric and morphologic measurements for all\nparticipants were conducted approximately 24 h prior to\nall strength measures and in the following sequence: height,\nbody mass, body composition, and muscle morphology.\nHeight (\u00010.1 cm) and body mass (\u00010.1 kg) were deter-\nmined using a Health-o-Meter Professional scale (Model\n500 KL, Pelstar, Alsip, IL) with the participants standing\nbarefoot, with feet together, and in their normal daily\nattire. Body composition, lean total body mass, and lean\nmass of the limbs were determined using whole body–dual\nenergy  x-ray  absorptiometry  (DXA)  scans  (Prodigy\nTM\n;\nLunar Corporation, Madison, WI). Total body estimates of\npercent fat (%FAT) and nonbone lean body mass (LBM;\n\u00010.1 kg) were determined using company’s recommended\nprocedures  and  supplied  algorithms.  Lean  arm  mass\n(ARM;\u00010.1 kg) was the sum of lean arm mass from both\narms, while lean leg mass (LEG;\u00010.1 kg) was similarly cal-\nculated, following manual demarcation of these regions of\ninterest. Quality assurance was assessed by daily calibra-\ntions performed prior to all scans using a calibration block\nprovided by the manufacturer.

This technique uses sound waves at\nfixed frequencies to create in vivo, real time images of the\nlimb musculature. Prior to image collection, all anatomi-\ncal locations of interest were identified using standardized\nlandmarks for the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis\n(VL), pectoralis major (PM), and triceps brachii (TB)\nmuscles. The landmarks for the RF and VL were identi-\nfied along the longitudinal distance over the femur at\n50% of the length of each muscle, respectively. The length\nof the RF was defined as the length between the anterior,\ninferior suprailiac crest and the proximal border of the\npatella, while the length of the VL encompassed the dis-\ntance from the lateral condyle of the tibia to the most\nprominent point of the greater trochanter of the femur.\nVL measurement required the participant lay on their\nside. For landmark identification (and ultrasound mea-\nsurement) of the PM, the participant was required to\ncontinue lying supine but with their dominant shoulder\nabducted and elbow flexed so that the dominant hand\nwas positioned behind their head. Initially, 50% of the\ndistance between the suprasternal notch and the most\ninferior point of the body of the sternum was identified.\nSubsequently, the cross-sectional distance from this point\nto the lateral most border of the muscle (approximately\nlevel with the second rib) was used for measurement.\nFinally, landmark identification of the TB required the\nparticipant to straddle the examination table and inter-\nnally rotate their dominant shoulder, flex the elbow, and\nrest their dominant hand upon their thigh. The specific\nlandmark for the TB was identified along the longitudinal\ndistance over the humerus at a position 40% of the dis-\ntance from the lateral epicondyle to the acromion process\nof the scapula (Ichinose et al. 1998). Subsequently, the\nparticipant resumed laying supine on the examination\ntable for a minimum of 15 min to allow fluid shifts to\noccur before images were collected (Berg et al. 1993). The\nsame investigator performed all landmark measurements\nfor each participant.\nA 12-MHz linear probe scanning head (General Electric\nLOGIQ P5, Wauwatosa, WI) was coated with water sol-\nuble transmission gel to optimize spatial resolution and\nused to collect all ultrasound images. Collection of each\nimage began with the probe being positioned on (and\nperpendicular to) the surface of the skin to provide\nacoustic contact without depressing the dermal layer.\nSubsequently,  the  extended  field  of  view  mode\n(gain=50 dB; image depth=5 cm) was used to capture\npanoramic images of the muscular regions of interest. For\neach region, two consecutive images were collected. Each\nof  these  images  included  a  horizontal  line  (~1 cm),\nlocated above the image, which was used for calibration\npurposes when analyzing the images offline (Chapman\net al. 2008).

A rolled towel was placed beneath the popli-\nteal fossa of the dominant leg, allowing for a 10°bend in\nthe knee as measured by a goniometer, and the dominant\nfoot secured (Bemben 2002). For the VL, the participant\nwas placed on their side with their legs together and the\nrolled towel between their needs. Once again, the legs\nwere positioned to allow a 10°bend in the knees, as mea-\nsured by a goniometer (Bemben 2002). Measurement of\nthe PM required the participant to lay supine, in the fash-\nion described above, while TB measurement required the\nparticipant to lay prone with their arms extended, resting\nat their side. For all muscles of interest, muscle cross-sec-\ntional area (CSA) was obtained using a cross-sectional\nsweep in the axial plane at each location across the mus-\ncle. In addition to these measures, longitudinal images at\n50% of the muscle length were used to determine muscle\nthickness (MT) in the RF and VL muscles (Cadore et al.\n2012). The same investigator positioned each participant\nand collected all images.\nAfter all images were collected, the ultrasound data\nwere transferred to a personal computer for analysis via\nImage J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,\nversion 1.45s) by the same technician. To measure CSA,\nthe polygon tracking tool in the Image J software was\nused to isolate as much lean muscle as possible without\nany surrounding bone or fascia in the RF, VL, TB, and\nPM (Cadore et al. 2012). Subsequently, Image J calculated\nthe area contained within the traced muscle image and\nreported this value in centimeter squared (\u00010.1 cm\n2\n).\nThe distance (\u00010.1 cm) between the superficial aponeu-\nrosis to the deep aponeurosis was used to determine MT\nin the RF and VL muscles.

Participants were sched-\nuled for testing at a standard time of day similar to their\ntraining schedule. A general warm up consisting of riding\na cycle ergometer for 5 min at a self-selected resistance\npreceded strength testing. The general warm up was\nfollowed by a specific warm up consisting of 10 body-\nweight squats, 10 alternating lunges, 10 walking “knee\nhugs,” and 10 walking “butt kicks.” Standardized proce-\ndures were used for the one repetition maximum (1RM)\nbarbell bench press and barbell back squat, respectively\n(Hoffman 2006). For each exercise, a warm-up set of 5–\n10 repetitions was performed using 40–60% of the partic-\nipant’s perceived 1RM. After a 1-min rest period, a set of\n2–3 repetitions was performed at 60–80% of the partici-\npant’s perceived 1RM. Subsequently, 3–5 maximal trials\n(one repetition sets) were performed to determine the\n1RM. For the bench press, proper technique was enforced\nby requiring all participants to maintain contact between\ntheir feet and the floor; their buttocks, shoulders, and\nhead with the bench; and use a standard grip (slightly\nwider than shoulder width) on the bar. Upon lowering\nthe bar to their chest, participants were required to pause\nbriefly and wait for an “UP!” signal before initiating con-\ncentric movement. The purpose for this pause was to\neliminate  the  influence  of  bouncing  and  distinguish\neccentric from concentric muscle activation during elec-\ntromyography analysis. Any trials that involved excessive\narching of the back or bouncing of the weight were dis-\ncarded. For the back squat, a successful attempt required\nthe participant to descend to the “parallel” position,\nwhere the greater trochanter of the femur was aligned\nwith the knee. At this point, an investigator located lateral\nto the participant, provided an “UP!” signal, indicating\nthat proper range of motion had been achieved; no pause\nwas required for the squat exercise. Rest periods between\nattempts were 2–3 min in length. Upon determining their\n1RM for each exercises, each participant was allotted a 5-\nmin rest period before completing three additional one\nrepetition sets with 40%, 60%, and 80% of their 1RM; 1-\nmin rest periods were provided between these sets.

Thus, improvements in muscle activation effi-\nciency were determined by comparing the changes in the\nactivation regression slope following the 8-week training\nprogram using the same loads assessed at PRE (deVries\n1968). In this way, an increase in the slope would indicate\ngreater  muscle  activation;  a  common  neuromuscular\nimprovement in novice lifters. However, a decrease (or\nreduction) in muscle activation would imply less muscle\nis necessary for the given task; or greater muscle activa-\ntion efficiency. Since the absolute loads remained consis-\ntent between PRE and POST, an improvement in muscle\nactivation efficiency would be the consequence of muscle\nhypertrophy occurring in an advanced lifter.\nResistance training intervention\nParticipants reported to the Human Performance Lab\n(HPL) four times per week to complete their assigned\ntraining program (see Table 1). Briefly, the INT training\nprogram required the participants to perform four sets at\n3–5 repetitions with 90% of their 1RM, with 3-min rest\nperiods between sets, while the VOL group performed\nfour sets at 10–12 repetitions with 70% of their 1RM,\nwith a 1-min rest period between sets. Both groups per-\nformed the same exercises. Training intensity was deter-\nmined from 1RM testing (bench press and squat) and\nestimated 1RM (all other exercises) (Brzycki 1993) from\neach participant’s performance during the preparatory\ntraining  phase.  Progressive  overload  was  achieved  by\nincreasing the load when all prescribed repetitions (for a\nparticular exercise) were achieved on two consecutive\nworkouts. Weekly training volume load was calculated as\nthe average of the number of repetitions9load in the\nsquat and bench press exercises. Following each training\nsession, participants were provided~235 mL of chocolate\nmilk (170 calories; 2.5 g fat; 29 g carbohydrate; 9 g pro-\ntein) or Lactaid\n\u0002\n(150 calories; 2.5 g fat; 24 g carbohy-\ndrate; 8 g protein) for lactose-intolerant participants. All\ntraining sessions occurred under the supervision of a\nCSCS.\nBlood sampling\nBlood samples were obtained at four time points: baseline\n(BL), immediately postexercise (IP), 30 min postexercise\n(30P),  and  60 min  postexercise  (60P).  Participants\nreported to the HPL 3 h postprandial, at a standardized\ntime of day consistent with their normal training sched-\nule. All blood samples at POST were taken at the same\ntime of day as PRE to avoid the confounding influence of\ndiurnal variations. All blood samples were obtained using\na Teflon cannula placed in a superficial forearm vein\nusing a three-way stopcock with a male luer lock adapter\nand plastic syringe. The cannula was maintained patent\nusing  an  isotonic  saline  solution  (Becton  Dickinson,\nFranklin Lakes, NJ). Blood samples at BL were obtained\nfollowing a 15-min equilibration period. Following the BL\nblood sample, participants were provided~235 mL of\nchocolate milk (170 calories; 2.5 g fat; 29 g carbohydrate;\n9 g protein) or Lactaid\n\u0002\n(150 calories; 2.5 g fat; 24 g car-\nbohydrate; 8 g protein). Following the resistance exercise\nprotocol, participants remained in the HPL for all subse-\nquent blood draws. IP blood samples were taken within\n1 min of exercise cessation. Following IP blood samples,\nparticipants  were  provided  their  normal~235 mL  of\nchocolate milk. Participants were instructed to lie in a\nsupine position for 15 min prior to the 30P and 60P\nblood draws.\nAll blood samples were collected into two Vacutainer\n\u0002\ntubes, one containing no anticlotting agent (6 mL) and\nthe second containing K\n2\nEDTA (6 mL). A small aliquot\nof whole blood was removed and used for determination\nof hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations. The blood\nin the first tube was allowed to clot at room temperature\nfor 30 min and subsequently centrifuged at 3000gfor\n15 min along with the remaining whole blood from the\nsecond tube. The resulting plasma and serum were placed\ninto separate microcentrifuge tubes and frozen at\u000380°C\nfor later analysis.\nBiochemical analysis\nHematocrit  concentrations  were  analyzed  from  whole\nblood via microcentrifugation (CritSpin, Westwood, MA)\nand microcapillary techniques. Hemoglobin concentra-\ntions were analyzed from whole blood using an auto-\nmated analyzer (HemoCue, Cypress, CA). Blood lactate\nconcentrations  were  analyzed  from  plasma  using  an\nautomated analyzer (Analox GM7 enzymatic metabolite\nanalyzer,  Analox  instruments  USA,  Lunenburg,  MA).\n2015 | Vol. 3 | Iss. 8 | e12472\nPage 6\nª2015 The Authors.Physiological Reportspublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of\nthe American Physiological Society and The Physiological Society.\nTraining Volume vs. Intensity on Strength and HypertrophyG.

Plasma volume shifts were calculated using the\nformula established by Dill and Costill (1974). To elimi-\nnate interassay variance, all samples were analyzed in\nduplicate by a single technician.\nCirculating concentrations of testosterone (TEST), cor-\ntisol (CORT), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), 22-kD\ngrowth hormone (GH), and insulin (INSL) were assessed\nvia enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a\nspectrophotometer (BioTek Eon, Winooski, VT) using\ncommercially available kits. To eliminate interassay vari-\nance, all samples for each assay were thawed once and\nanalyzed in duplicate in the same assay run by a single\ntechnician. Samples were analyzed in duplicate, with an\naverage coefficient of variation of 3.74% for TEST, 4.03%\nfor CORT, 6.77% IGF-1, 3.50% for GH, and 6.54% for\nINSL. The area under the curve (AUC), expressed in arbi-\ntrary units (au) via the trapezoidal method, was calcu-\nlated and used to analyze the total training response.\nBlood variables were not corrected for plasma volume\nshifts due to the importance of molar exposure at the tis-\nsue receptor level.\nNutrient intake and dietary analysis\nParticipants were instructed to maintain their normal\nkilocaloric intake habits throughout the course of the\ninvestigation. Kilocaloric and macronutrient intake were\nmonitored via weekly food diaries. Consequently, all par-\nticipants were required to record all food and beverage\nintake over the course of 3 days (two weekdays and one\nweekend day) during the week of PRE (week 2) and\nPOST (week 10). The FoodWorks Dietary Analysis soft-\nware version 13 (The Nutrition Company, Long Valley,\nNJ) was used to analyze dietary recalls. For statistical\nanalysis, total caloric, macronutrient (protein, carbohy-\ndrate, and fat), and branched chain amino acid (leucine,\nisoleucine, and valine) intake were analyzed relative to\nbody mass.\nStatistical analysis\nTo identify differences between training protocols on\nchanges in muscle size, strength, and activation, an analy-\nsis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed on all mea-\nsures collected at POST. Associated values collected at\nPRE were used as the covariate to eliminate the possible\ninfluence of initial score variances on training outcomes.\nFollowing any significantFratio, a paired samplet-test\nwas  used  to  determine  whether  significant  difference\nexisted between measures collected prior to and immedi-\nately following 8 weeks of training. To examine if the\nchanges could be considered real, all individual changes\nin body composition measures were compared to their\ncalculated MD (Weir 2005). Using (eq. 1), MD is deter-\nmined by creating a 95% confidence interval about the\nstandard error of the measurement (SEM). Thus, any\nchange occurring within this confidence interval would be\ninterpreted as being consistent with the measurement\nerror of the test, while changes occurring outside of the\ninterval reflect real changes in body composition.\nMD¼SEM\u00041:96\u0004\nffiffiffi\n2\np\n(1)\nTo examine group differences in the acute endocrine\nresponse to exercise during WK3 and WK10, a repeated\nmeasures ANCOVA was performed, where hormone con-\ncentrations at baseline (of WK3 and WK10, respectively)\nwere used as the covariate. In the event of a significant\ninteraction,  a  repeated  measures  analysis  of  variance\n(ANOVA) was performed on each group individually at\nWK3 and WK10. In the event of a significantFratio,\nleast squared distance (LSD) post hoc analysis was used\nto determine significant differences between each time\npoint (i.e., IP, 30P, and 60P) and baseline hormone con-\ncentrations. The effect of training on AUC measures was\nalso analyzed by a repeated measure ANOVA. In the\nevent of a significantFratio, an independentt-test was\nused to assess group differences at WK3 and WK10.\nAll between group differences were further analyzed\nusing effect sizes (g\n2\n: Partial eta squared). Interpretations\nof effect size were evaluated (Cohen 1988) at the follow-\ning  levels:  small  effect  (0.01–0.058),  medium  effect\n(0.059–0.137), and large effect (>0.138). A criterion alpha\nlevel ofP≤0.05 was used to determine statistical signifi-\ncance. All data are reported as mean\u0001standard devia-\ntion.

These results are con-\nsistent with previous comparative studies in resistance-\ntrained individuals showing high-intensity programs were\nmore conducive for increasing strength while producing\nsimilar magnitude of muscle hypertrophy (Brandenburg\nand Docherty 2002; Schoenfeld et al. 2014). However, the\ngreater gains in some measures of muscle size observed in\nINT indicate that high-intensity training may provide a\ngreater stimulus for muscle hypertrophy in trained men.\nIn addition, the hormonal responses for testosterone were\nsimilar between groups. At WK3, the GH and cortisol\nresponses  were  greater  for  VOL  compared  to  INT.\nAlthough both the GH and cortisol responses in VOL\nwere attenuated after 8 weeks of training, the cortisol\nresponse remained greater. No differences were noted in\nthe IGF-1 and insulin responses between groups in addi-\ntion to the testosterone response.\nChanges in strength are generally thought to be the\nresult of a combination of neurological activation and\nskeletal muscle adaptation (Moritani and deVries 1979;\nMoritani  1993).  Initial  strength  gains  in  previously\nuntrained individuals have been associated with neurolog-\nical adaptations that involve a more efficient activation\npattern of activated musculature (Moritani and deVries\n1979). However, improvements in the magnitude and\nefficiency of muscle activation during exercise appear to\nbe  limited  in  resistance-trained  populations  (deVries\n1968; Moritani and deVries 1979; Moritani 1993). Conse-\nquently, any change in muscle activation is likely the\nresult of a change in muscle size. A previous study in\nresistance-trained  athletes  reported  significant  strength\ngains within the first few weeks of training (Hoffman\net al. 2009). This was attributed to the participants enter-\ning the intervention following several weeks of detraining\nand rapidly adapting to the familiar training stimulus. To\nminimize any “relearning effect,” a 2-week “pretraining”\nperiod was used prior to any performance assessments in\nthe present study. As such, any change in muscle activa-\ntion is likely the result of the specific training program\nand not related to a relearning effect.\nResults of this study noted similar changes in muscle\nactivation efficiency for both groups, as well as similar\nchanges in strength and size of the lower extremity. These\nfindings are in agreement with a previous study examin-\ning improvements in muscle activation efficiency follow-\ning 12 weeks of isometric training (Komi et al. 1978).\nAlthough no differences were observed between groups, it\nis possible that 8 weeks was not sufficient to reveal differ-\nences in the lower extremity of resistance-trained men\n(Abe et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2011). Unlike the upper\nextremity, where group differences in strength gains and\nhypertrophy were observed, the musculature of the lower\nlimbs have been observed to be more resistant to exer-\ncise-induced  muscle  damage  (Chen  et al.  2011)  and\nslower to respond to training (Abe et al. 2000). Thus, a\nlonger training period may be necessary to determine\nwhether high-intensity or high-volume training is more\nadvantageous for inducing lower extremity strength and\nsize improvements in an experienced population.\nThe mechanical and metabolic stresses imposed by\nresistance training are believed to influence changes in\nmuscle size (deVries 1968; Moritani and deVries 1979;\nMoritani 1993). In this study, the greater mechanical\nstress imposed by INT was also accompanied by greater\ngains in upper body muscle growth. This contrasts with\nprevious investigations which showed that the mechanical\nand metabolic stresses of high-volume and high-intensity\nTable 3.Group differences in changes in muscle activation efficiency during submaximal and maximal squat assessment following 8 weeks of\ntraining.\nCovariatePOSTFP-valueg\n2\np\n95% Confidence\ninterval\nLowerUpper\nVastus lateralis (b1)\nVOL3.182.23\u00011.780.6640.4230.0261.6033.160\nINT2.08\u00010.841.1522.708\nRectus femoris (b1)\nVOL3.121.70\u00011.170.4680.5000.0181.3962.251\nINT1.75\u00010.831.1932.048\nMuscle activation efficiency was calculated as the percent change (b1) in muscle activation as resistance increased from 40% to 100% 1RM\nat PRE.\nª2015 The Authors.Physiological Reportspublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of\nthe American Physiological Society and The Physiological Society.\n2015 | Vol. 3 | Iss. 8 | e12472\nPage 11\nG.

These differences may\nbe explained, in part, by the level of tissue activation\nassociated with the exercise selection (Tipton et al. 2001;\nGoto et al. 2004). Notably, the limited number of multi-\nple joint structural exercises used per training session in\nthose studies. Brandenburg and Docherty (2002) used\nonly two single-joint, open-chain exercises (i.e., preacher\ncurl  and  supine  elbow  extension)  per  session,  while\nSchoenfeld et al. (2014) required three exercises per ses-\nsion (i.e., 19upper body push, 19upper body pull,\nand 19lower body movement) out of a pool of nine\nexercises that included both single- and multiple joint\nmovements. Although speculative, it is possible that the\ngreater morphological changes observed in INT were the\nconsequence of greater muscle activation generated from\nthe inclusion of several multiple joint exercises per work-\nout. The higher intensity protocol likely activated more\nmuscle fibers during exercise (Henneman et al. 1965),\nstimulating greater adaptation across a larger percentage\nof muscle (Clarkson et al. 1992; Ratamess et al. 2009).\nThe acute endocrine responses observed in our study\nwere consistent with previous investigations (Kraemer\net al. 1990; Hakkinen and Pakarinen 1993; Schwab et al.\n1993; Hakkinen et al. 2000; Hameed et al. 2004; McKay\net al. 2008; McCaulley et al. 2009; West et al. 2009, 2010;\nGregory et al. 2013). The high-volume resistance training\nprotocol resulted in significantly greater elevations in GH\nand cortisol concentrations, compared to the high-inten-\nsity  training  protocols,  while  similar  increases  were\nobserved between the training protocols in the testos-\nterone, IGF-1, and insulin responses to exercise. Eleva-\ntions in the anabolic hormones testosterone, GH, and\nIGF-1 are thought to be advantageous for muscle growth\nand strength gain (Kraemer and Ratamess 2005; Ratamess\net al. 2009). The elevations in GH and cortisol observed\nin VOL were likely in response to the metabolic demands\nof the exercise protocol, as reflected by the significantly\nhigher lactate measures seen in VOL compared to INT\n(Moller et al. 1995; Schakman et al. 2013). Furthermore,\nthe effect of 8 weeks of training appeared to attenuate\nboth the GH and cortisol responses to exercise in VOL.\nWhile this is in contrast to previous studies (McCall et al.\n1999; Hakkinen et al. 2000; Buresh et al. 2009; Mitchell\net al. 2013), it may reflect metabolic adaptations to the\nexercise stimulus (Burgomaster et al. 2003; Kraemer and\nRatamess 2005). The elevated GH observed at IP (WK10)\nfor INT may reflect the increase in absolute load being\nused, making this program metabolically more stressful;\nthough it was not sufficient to alter the cortisol response.\nThe  similar  responses  of  testosterone  and  IGF-1\nobserved between the training protocols, at both WK3\nand WK10, suggest that differences in acute program\nvariables (i.e., intensity, volume, and rest) may not stimu-\nlate significant differences in the response of these ana-\nbolic hormones when assessed only the first and last week\nof an 8-week training program. Previous investigations\nhave reported a similar testosterone response following\nboth heavy (3–6 RM) and moderate (9–10 RM) loading\nTable 4.Changes in the endocrine response (area under the curve) to exercise following 8 weeks of training.\nGroup meansGroup9Time effectTime effect\nPREPOSTFP-valueg\n2\nptP-value\nTestosterone\nVolume32.4\u00016.532.7\u00017.30.1510.7010.0070.060.952\nIntensity36.4\u000117.535.9\u000120.2\nCortisol\nVolume2240.4\u0001716.4*1769.8\u0001756.6\n#\n7.6040.0110.2412.7030.019\nIntensity933.9\u0001555.51003.9\u0001557.8\u00030.7770.452\nIGF-1\nVolume318.7\u000194.3332.0\u000196.66.0200.0210.194\u00030.8430.416\nIntensity407.6\u0001141.0367.7\u0001133.42.6760.019\nGrowth hormone\nVolume23.6\u000122.3*9.1\u00019.55.9640.0220.1932.2850.041\nIntensity3.6\u00013.04.4\u00013.80.5950.562\nInsulin\nVolume300.1\u000177.9290.3\u000170.00.3790.5440.0151.1980.242\nIntensity323.8\u0001131.6291.8\u000185.3\n*Significant (P<0.05) group difference at PRE.\n#\nSignificant (P<0.05) group difference at POST.\nª2015 The Authors.Physiological Reportspublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of\nthe American Physiological Society and The Physiological Society.\n2015 | Vol. 3 | Iss. 8 | e12472\nPage 13\nG.

Variability in the testosterone response is\nlikely related to the degree of mechanical stress present\n(i.e.,  loading).  Kraemer  et al.  (1990)  have  previously\ndemonstrated elevated testosterone concentrations only\nwhen heavy (i.e., 5RM with 1- or 3-min rest) or moderate\n(i.e., 10RM with 1-min rest) loadings were used to induce\nfatigue. When moderate loads and long rest intervals (i.e.,\n10RM with 3-min rest) were used, this stimulus did not\nappear to be sufficient to cause consistent elevations in\ntestosterone concentrations. Similarly, IGF-1 concentra-\ntions have been reported to remain at baseline concentra-\ntions following high-volume resistance exercise when the\nexercise protocol consisted of only two unilateral exercises\nwith a long rest period (6–10 RM; 3-min rest) (Wilkinson\net al. 2006), or when training included both high (5RM)\nand moderate (10RM) intensity with longer rest periods\n(2–3 min) (Nindl et al. 2001; Spiering et al. 2008). The\nvariability  seen  in  the  acute  testosterone  and  IGF-1\nresponse to a bout of resistance exercise suggests that dif-\nferent combinations of both metabolic and mechanical\nstimuli may be required to foster such changes.\nElevations in IGF-1 concentrations are thought to be\nstimulated by a high mechanical stimulus (Bamman et al.\n2001; Hameed et al. 2004; Gregory et al. 2013). However,\nelevations in GH have also been reported to stimulate\nIGF-1 release (Hameed et al. 2004; Iida et al. 2004; Gre-\ngory et al. 2013). In this study, IGF-1 concentrations were\nsimilarly elevated between groups at WK3 and WK10\nthough GH concentrations were only similar between\ngroups at WK10. In VOL, an attenuated GH (AUC)\nresponse was noted following training, while the IGF-1\n(AUC) response remained consistent. In contrast, the\nresponse seen for INT was slightly different; the GH\n(AUC) response remained consistent, while IGF-1 (AUC)\nwas attenuated. Nevertheless, both observations question\nthe role that GH has on the IGF-1 response to acute exer-\ncise. Furthermore, these results are consistent with other\ninvestigations  that  have  reported  dissimilar  responses\nfrom GH to IGF-1 following resistance exercise (Wilkin-\nson et al. 2006; Spiering et al. 2008; Hasani-Ranjbar et al.\n2012). Interestingly, Hameed et al. (2004) reported that\nelevations in GH (exogenous administration) combined\nwith a resistance exercise stimulus resulted in significant\nelevations in both circulating and intramuscular IGF-1.\nAlthough the combination of both GH administration\nand  resistance  exercise  resulted  in  a  greater  IGF-1\nresponse than any of the stimuli alone, 12 weeks of GH\nadministration was reported to increase intramuscular\nIGF-1  concentrations  and  attenuate  circulating  IGF-1\nconcentrations. Although intramuscular IGF-1 was not\nexamined in this study, this may provide some explana-\ntion for the attenuation in the IGF-1 response to INT at\nWK10.\nUnlike the GH and IGF-1 responses to exercise, which\nappear to be influenced by changes in metabolic stress\n(Vanhelder et al. 1984; Hakkinen and Pakarinen 1993)\nand possibly changes in GH concentration (Hameed et al.\n2004; Iida et al. 2004; Gregory et al. 2013), respectively,\nthe mechanisms underlying the changes in the testos-\nterone  response  to  exercise  are  less  clear.  Previous\nresearch has reported no changes in the testosterone\nresponse to exercise (McCall et al. 1999; Bell et al. 2000;\nHakkinen et al. 2000; Wilkinson et al. 2006) or an atten-\nuated response following prolonged (2–6 months) train-\ning (Buresh et al. 2009; West et al. 2010; Mitchell et al.\n2013). In the present study, neither protocol induced any\nchanges in the testosterone response to exercise. These\nresults are consistent with previous research using high-\nvolume (McCall et al. 1999; Bell et al. 2000; Wilkinson\net al. 2006) and high-intensity (Bell et al. 2000) resistance\ntraining protocols for 8–12 weeks in duration. While it\nmay be possible that the 8-week training period used in\nthis study was too short to stimulate any adaptation, the\ntestosterone response to an acute bout of resistance exer-\ncise has also been reported to remain similar for up to\n6 months of training (Hakkinen et al. 2000). Others have\nreported a reduced response following 10–16 weeks of\nhigh-volume training (Buresh et al. 2009; West et al.\n2010). Consequently, there does not appear to be a clear\npattern  or  mechanism  of  change  in  the  testosterone\nresponse to resistance training.\nInsulin concentrations in both groups were shown to\nbe significantly elevated from BL at IP through 60P dur-\ning both WK3 and WK10. While this response is in con-\ntrast to many studies showing insulin concentrations\ndecreasing from baseline during exercise (Thyfault et al.\n2004; Spiering  et al. 2008), these differences  may be\nrelated to the feedings provided during the study. All par-\nticipants were provided~235 mL of chocolate milk (or\nLactaid\n\u0002\n) following baseline blood sample collection (be-\nfore exercise), and immediately following the IP blood\ndraw. Previous research has demonstrated that ingestion\nof a protein/carbohydrate beverage surrounding the work-\nout will result in an elevation in insulin concentrations\n(Tipton et al. 2001; Thyfault et al. 2004). It is possible\nthat any differences in the insulin response to the differ-\nent training protocols may have been masked by the pre-\nand postexercise feedings.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study indicate that\nhigh-intensity (3–5 RM), low-volume resistance training\n2015 | Vol. 3 | Iss. 8 | e12472\nPage 14\nª2015 The Authors.Physiological Reportspublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of\nthe American Physiological Society and The Physiological Society.\nTraining Volume vs. Intensity on Strength and HypertrophyG.
